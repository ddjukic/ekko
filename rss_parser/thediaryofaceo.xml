    <title>The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett</title>
    <language>en</language>
    <copyright></copyright>
    <description>A few years ago I was a broke, university dropout, at 18 I built an industry leading social media marketing company, and at 27 I resigned as CEO. At 28 I co-founded Flight Story – a marketing and communications company, and thirdweb - a software platform, making it easy to build web3 applications. I then launched private equity fund, Flight Fund, to accelerate the next generation of European unicorns. During this time I I decided to launch 'The Diary Of A CEO' podcast with the simple mission of providing an unfiltered journey into the remarkable stories and untold dimensions of the world’s most influential people, experts and thinkers. Thank you for listening.

      <title>Moment 149: Why You Are Easily Distracted &amp; How To FIX it! Nir Eyal</title>
      <description>In this moment, behaviour and habit design expert, Nir Eyal discusses how to beat procrastination and distraction. One of the first major steps is being able to master the internal triggers that are trying to pull your attention away. Nir believes that to do this you need to try and understand the underlying feelings behind these urge. As he says, time management is pain management, and all human behaviour is about trying to escape discomfort. Nir says that finding these underlying feelings can be achieved by writing down the sensations you feel just before distraction, this allows you identify them and then reframe them to your advantage. Because, if you don’t master these internal triggers, they become your master. Another major step to beat procrastination is by actually scheduling time to be distracted. Nir calls this ‘The 10 Minute Rule’, which allows you to give in to any distraction in your scheduled time, but only for 10 minutes!

      <title>Moment 148: Guarantee Financial Freedom! The 4 Numbers You NEED To Be Tracking: Ramit Sethi</title>
      <description>In this moment, personal finance expert Rami Sethi breaks down the 4 finance numbers everyone needs to know and what exactly a ‘rich life’ is. Ramit says that most people don’t have even the most basic understanding of money, compare this to other areas of life such as driving, where we need to know the rules of the road before putting a key in the ignition. However, personal finance is actually incredibly simple and Ramit says that the four numbers you need to track are: your fixed costs like rent and groceries, savings, investments, and guilt free spending. From these numbers, Ramit says that he can see what are a person’s priorities and outlook on life. But more revealing is someone’s idea of their ‘rich life’. This is what a person’s life would look like if they finally reached the level of wealth they are chasing. Ramit says too often people’s answer to what their rich life is vague, for instance, saying they want to be able to do what they want when they want, or to have freedom. These answers are so vague as people have never really thought about this question before, but Ramit say they need to think about this potential future deeply and in detail so that they can truly envision it.

      <title>Moment 147: Stop These Habits That Are Destroying Your Body!: Mindy Pelz</title>
      <description>In this moment, nutrition and functional health expert , Mindy Pelz discusses how we often treat our body as if it was an enemy working against us and our interests. Mindy discusses how evolution has actually shaped the human body so that it is constantly looking to increase your chances of survival. However, in the modern world we are getting in the way of our body’s natural defence mechanism, and taking actions that are against our own and our body’s interests, this can include injecting ourselves with weight loss drugs and using toxic deodorants, causing larger health problems later in life. Mindy says that in general we seem to be in a ‘evolutionary mismatch’ with our bodies and need to regain trust in them.

      <title>World's No. 1 Exercise Professor: "Our Comfortable Lives Are Causing Cancer", "The Truth About Running", "Hand Sanitiser Is Making You Sick!</title>
      <description>We may have health monitors and fitness trackers, but could it be the case that even with this technology, humans are actually reversing evolutionary progress?

Dr Lieberman is the Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. His research focuses on how the human body has evolved to be the way it is, he also explores how humans evolved to run long distances to scavenge and hunt. He is the author of the best-selling books, ‘The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease’ and ‘Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding’.

In this conversation Daniel and Steven discuss topics, such as if human evolution is going backwards, why veganism is not the answer, how commuting is making you fat and what we can learn from hunter-gatherers.

(00:00) Intro
(02:00) What do you do, and why do you do it?
(03:09) Are we actually a good species?
(05:11) Do our ancestors hold the answer to all our health needs?
(07:32) Have we evolved to eat meat?
(10:33) How did we learn to hunt and gather?
(17:03) Have we evolved to breathe wrong?
(19:28) Why do we sweat?
(24:23) When did our brains get so big?
(29:55) Why do we struggle to diet?
(38:31) Modern-day mismatched diseases
(42:41) Why did you write a book about food?
(45:02) Has our culture moved too fast?
(46:15) We've decided to live with diseases rather than prevent them.
(50:13) The modern foods we eat have affected the way we look.
(53:02) Is cancer a consequence of our modern society?
(58:34) How our bodies store energy
(01:05:23) The keto diet and fasting
(01:09:44) Are we too comfortable as a society?
(01:14:59) Puberty has changed, and we’re going into it earlier than ever before.
(01:16:37) The dangers of sitting down all day like we do.
(01:20:08) What should people take away most from this conversation?
(01:24:16) The products we put on our bodies, are they toxic?
(01:30:06) The last guest's question

      <itunes:summary>We may have health monitors and fitness trackers, but could it be the case that even with this technology, humans are actually reversing evolutionary progress?

Dr Lieberman is the Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. His research focuses on how the human body has evolved to be the way it is, he also explores how humans evolved to run long distances to scavenge and hunt. He is the author of the best-selling books, ‘The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease’ and ‘Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding’.

In this conversation Daniel and Steven discuss topics, such as if human evolution is going backwards, why veganism is not the answer, how commuting is making you fat and what we can learn from hunter-gatherers.

(00:00) Intro
(02:00) What do you do, and why do you do it?
(03:09) Are we actually a good species?
(05:11) Do our ancestors hold the answer to all our health needs?
(07:32) Have we evolved to eat meat?
(10:33) How did we learn to hunt and gather?
(17:03) Have we evolved to breathe wrong?
(19:28) Why do we sweat?
(24:23) When did our brains get so big?
(29:55) Why do we struggle to diet?
(38:31) Modern-day mismatched diseases
(42:41) Why did you write a book about food?
(45:02) Has our culture moved too fast?
(46:15) We've decided to live with diseases rather than prevent them.
(50:13) The modern foods we eat have affected the way we look.
(53:02) Is cancer a consequence of our modern society?
(58:34) How our bodies store energy
(01:05:23) The keto diet and fasting
(01:09:44) Are we too comfortable as a society?
(01:14:59) Puberty has changed, and we’re going into it earlier than ever before.
(01:16:37) The dangers of sitting down all day like we do.
(01:20:08) What should people take away most from this conversation?
(01:24:16) The products we put on our bodies, are they toxic?

      <title>Moment 146: 3 Simple Steps That Guarantees Ultimate Happiness (Jay Shetty's Happiness Model)</title>
      <description>In this moment, the podcaster, author, and life coach, Jay Shetty discusses how he believes people can find happiness. Jay says that it can be found in two forms, the sort of happiness that comes from daily habits and a more enriching happiness that arises out of deeper purposes. While most of us know what we can do for our daily happiness levels, deeper happiness that comes from finding our meaning and purpose in life is more complicated and vague. However, for Jay this deeper happiness comes from locating your passion, and more than just finding what you love, using this passion in the service of others, as this brings the most enriching happiness in life.

(23:50) What's Causing This Mental Health Epidemic?
(26:12) The Cutting-Edge Research on the Link Between Metabolism and Mental Health
(31:40) How Is the Mitochondria Crucial in Fixing Mental Health Issues?
(38:45) How Does the Mitochondria Relate to Trauma?
(43:53) What's Happening in Our Bodies When We Experience Trauma?

      <title>The Fasting Doctor: “Fasting Cures Obesity!”, This Controversial New Drug Melts Fat, Fasting Fixes Hormones! Skip Breakfast!</title>
      <description>There seems to be endless ways to lose weight and yet none seem to work, but could it be that there was one health metric that held the key to long term weight loss?

Dr Jason Fung is a nephrologist (medical expert specialising in kidneys) and world-leading expert in intermittent fasting and low-carb diets. He is the author of bestselling books such as, ‘The Obesity Code’, ‘The Diabetes Code’, and ‘The Complete Guide to Fasting’.

In this interview, Steven and Dr Jason discuss everything from  the history behind dieting myths, how insulin causes weight gain, why you don’t need breakfast, how obesity is genetic, and the power of fasting.

      <title>Moment 145: The Alarming Link Between Your GUT &amp; Depression: Tim Spector</title>
      <description>In this week’s moment, gut health and diet expert Dr Tim Spector discusses the power of the microbiome, your crucial community of gut microbes. Discoveries about the microbiome have exploded in the last 10 years and revolutionised the way we see the tiny bugs living within our intestine. Tim sees the microbiome as an incredible pharmacy within us, as individual microbes pump out vital chemicals for your immune system. These chemicals also affect brain function and your moods, playing a vital role in depression, as this is directly linked to the quality of your gut microbes. How do you improve your microbiome? Food plays a vital role in feeding microbes, Tim says the key is to consume as diverse a range of plants as possible, aiming for 30 different types of plants a week to maximise the diversity of species in your gut.

      <title>Moment 144: How To ACTUALLY Break Bad Habits: Joe Dispenza</title>
      <description>In this moment, New York Times best-selling author and researcher, Dr Joe Dispenza discusses how to change habits. A habit forms when you’ve done something so many times that it becomes hardwired into your subconscious, and is even programmed into the very nerve cells of your brain. So in order to break a habit, you have to break the bigger habit of being yourself. Dr Dispenza says that this change can happen when we become conscious of our unconscious. This awareness can come from meditation, as well as mentally rehearsing changes we want to make, so that we avoid the trap of unconsciously making the same choices everyday. By mentally rehearsing scenarios, this avoids the uncomfortableness that comes from taking a step into the unknown and stops you from being the creator of your life.

      <title>Yuval Noah Harari: The Urgent Warning They Hope You Ignore, “More War Is Coming”, Yuval’s Chilling Future Predictions!</title>
      <description>He has shown millions of readers how humans have evolved to where we are now, but what does the future hold for us as a species?

Yuval Noah Harari is a best-selling author, public intellectual and Professor of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is best known for his bestselling books, ‘Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind’, ‘Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow’ and ‘21 Lessons for the 21st Century’. His books have sold over 45 Million copies in 65 languages.

In this interview, Steven and Yuval discuss everything from how AI will change everything, the importance of language and stories, why the idea of finding a ‘soulmate’ is a myth, and the ongoing battle for human attention.

      <title>Thierry Henry (EXCLUSIVE): "I Cried Every Single Day", Dealing With Depression, My Childhood Trauma &amp; Fighting For My Dad's Love!</title>
      <description>What does it take to become a Premier League GOAT, and what does it take from you when you walk away from the game?

Thierry Henry is a French professional football coach, broadcaster and former player. He is regarded as one of the best strikers and Premier League player of all time, and France’s highest-ever international goalscorer. He began his professional career in 1994 and played for Arsenal from 1999 to 2007, he is the club’s all-time leading goal scorer with 226 goals. He was PFA player of the year twice, in 2003 and 2004, and European Golden Boot twice, in 2004 and 2005, he retired as a player in 2014 and is now coach of the under-21 French national team.

In this interview, Steven and Thierry discuss everything from the expectations of Thierry's family that he would become a great football player, never feeling good enough, always wanting to get his father’s approval, ‘dying’ when he stopped playing football and his mental struggles after the game.

      <title>Moment 143: This Is Why You Can't Lose Weight: Daniel Lieberman</title>
      <description>In this moment, Harvard University professor and best-selling author, Daniel Lieberman, busts some of the most common myths around exercise. For 2 of the biggest myths, Daniel says that they are too simplistic, saying that you must sleep 8 hours a night or that sitting is terrible for your health. Instead, he says that most people do better with 7 hours of sleep a night, (but this can change depending on age and health) also, sitting isn’t bad for you if you mix it up with regular interruptions. Daniel also helps to clear up the debate that exercise does nothing for weight loss. He says the problem is actually that the recommended 150 minutes per week of exercise is not nearly enough, but higher levels of exercise lead to sustained weight loss and prevents regaining weight after losing it. In reality he claim that most of the truth about diet and exercise is more complex than we are led to believe.

In this conversation, Dr Will and Steven discuss everything from, the power of the microbiome, why fibre is crucial for optimal health, the importance of understanding your poo, and why food can be just as powerful as medication.

      <title>Moment 142: These Daily Habits Are Slowly Killing You: Peter Attia</title>
      <description>In this moment, longevity expert and author of  ‘Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity’, Dr Peter Attia discusses ‘Medicine 3.0’.
Most people in today’s world will die from lifestyle diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. In fact, Dr Attia says that our life expectancy hasn’t greatly increased since the 1800s, medicine just means we don’t die from infectious diseases.
To live longer and better in our later years, Dr Attia says that we need a new playbook, or what he calls ‘Medicine 3.0’. This relies on taking preventative steps very early in life, as the risk of lifestyle diseases compound throughout our life. Dr Attia argues that while doctors practising traditional medicine are very aware of the risk of doing certain treatments, but often ignore the cost of not taking action to prevent future problems.
Dr Attia believes that too often we worry about our health too late in life, when the problems start and the risk of taking action is higher. Instead, he argues, that if we take action when we are younger we have so much potential to change the trajectory of our lives. He says that we should start worrying about our future health now, and should think about it the same way as we think about saving for retirement, if we invest now we will thank ourselves later.

      <title>Moment 141: What Coffee Is REALLY Doing To Your Sleep!: Matthew Walker</title>
      <description>In this moment, sleep expert and author of ‘Why We Sleep’, Matthew Walker discusses the 3 main reasons why caffeine is so terrible for sleep.
Firstly, is that the impact of caffeine lasts long after drinking a cup of coffee. Caffeine has a quarter life of between 10 to 12 hours, which means if you have a cup of coffee at midday, a quarter of that caffeine is still in your brain at midnight.
Secondly, as a stimulant, caffeine mutes the chemical, adenosine, which is in charge of sleepiness. However, the adenosine is still there and builds, so when caffeine leaves your system you get a caffeine crash, which is all the sleepiness that has been built up hitting at once.
Finally, caffeine blocks deep sleep by between 15 to 30%. So even if you are able to fall asleep after drinking coffee, it will be poor quality sleep, and you lose out the amazing benefits of deep sleep, such as: regulating your cardiovascular system, replenishing the immune system, and securing new memories into your brain.
However, Matthew doesn’t say that people should completely give up coffee, but instead the main thing to look out for is how much you drink and the timing of when you drink it.

      <title>Michael Bublé: "I Will NEVER Be Carefree Again!", Cancer Diagnosis, Dealing With Rejection &amp; Being Mr Christmas!</title>
      <description>Most people think of Michael Bublé as the soundtrack of Christmas, yet often overlooked is his unwavering dedication to his music, the personal challenges he’s faced and the mission he’s on.

From summers of catching and sorting salmon on his father’s arctic fishing boat, to earning his 10,000 hours performing songs in the clubs, malls and cruise ships of Canada. Michael has earned his success, including 5 Grammy wins, 15 Juno awards, 6 multi-platinum albums, and well over 14 billions streams worldwide.
Bublé is a true family man, yet his journey has been marked by having to overcome severe adversity, including the cancer diagnosis of his eldest son.

This year, Michael announced the launch of his whiskey brand, Fraser &amp; Thompson Whiskey, created in partnership with longtime friend, award-winning Master Distiller and Blender, Paul Cirka.

This is the real Michael Bublé, you just haven’t met him yet.

      <title>Moment 140: The 2 Minute Trick That Beats Procrastinating For Good: Ali Abdaal</title>
      <description>In this moment, YouTube and productivity expert, Ali Abdaal discusses the power of consistency and how to overcome procrastination. Ali discusses the power of compounding interest, and how small actions over time can snowball into trigger larger rapid changes such as viral success from making a YouTube video every week for 2 years. However, to get to this position, Ali says you have to first learn to love the process, moving away from an outcome based mindset that means success is out of your control, and instead to a view of success that comes from within. To get there first means overcoming hurdles such as procrastination. In order to do this, Ali says you should move away from focusing on a large end goal and instead focus on a series of smaller goals along the was. So rather than worrying about moving a whole mountain, people should focus on moving one pebble at a time.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this moment, YouTube and productivity expert, Ali Abdaal discusses the power of consistency and how to overcome procrastination. Ali discusses the power of compounding interest, and how small actions over time can snowball into trigger larger rapid changes such as viral success from making a YouTube video every week for 2 years. However, to get to this position, Ali says you have to first learn to love the process, moving away from an outcome based mindset that means success is out of your control, and instead to a view of success that comes from within. To get there first means overcoming hurdles such as procrastination. In order to do this, Ali says you should move away from focusing on a large end goal and instead focus on a series of smaller goals along the was. So rather than worrying about moving a whole mountain, people should focus on moving one pebble at a time.</p><p>Listen to the full episode here - <a href="https://g2ul0.app.link/kHoT6TnDwFb">https://g2ul0.app.link/kHoT6TnDwFb</a></p><p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</a></p><p>Ali: <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/">https://aliabdaal.com/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal">https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 139: "Your Inner Voice Is Limiting You!" How To Control The Negative Inner Thoughts: Mo Gowdat</title>
      <description>In this moment, ex-chief business officer for Google X, Mo Gawdat asks the question, ‘what are the illusions that you are living under’? Mo believes, that for all of us, our view of reality is an illusion, and this can often become limiting or imprisoning. Too often this viewpoint of reality can lead to an identity you form that you feel that you have to stick with and cannot break away from. Furthermore, Mo says that for a lot of people, inner conflict comes when your actions don’t match with the inner feelings you have, so you don’t feel as if you’re fully complete. To overcome this, Mo says that we need to find balance within ourselves and that this balance can be broken down to smaller, more manageable sections that you can improve on every single day, as ultimately, this search for inner balance is a constant journey.

      <title>Moment 138: The Power of Letting Go &amp; Embracing the Unknown Bozoma Saint John</title>
      <description>In this moment, the American businessperson and marketing executive, Bozoma Saint John discusses how to find your destiny. Bozoma says that too often people say that they just ‘fell into’ the job or industry they are in, when in fact she believes that this is destiny coming to find you and  that we are constantly creating our destiny. She says that we underestimate the power of letting go of control (which is not the same as surrendering or giving up) as a way of opening up to different possibilities and routes to finding our destiny.  As too often we bang our heads against closed doors, when instead there is an open door that is open on a different route.  To realise this, she says we need to treat our powers of intuition like a muscle, ignoring external voices and opinions, training and growing your intuition to the point where you can have 100% faith in whatever it is telling you.

      <title>Moment 137: Finance Isn’t Rocket Science! The 2 Simple Skills Billionaires Use Everyday: Codie Sanchez</title>
      <description>In this moment, investor and financial educator, Codie Sanchez discusses the first steps in understanding the game of finance and deals. Codie says herself that she is no financial genius, however with her background as a journalist, she is able to right the ask right questions to the right people in order to get the right answers. Through this she was able to infiltrate the world of finance and saw behind the curtain. Codie realised there is no difference between a $100 million deal and a $100,000 deal, all were just slight larger steps up the ladder. To see behind the curtain, Codie believes there are 2 key skills people need to realise: firstly, learn how to do deals, which is not complex but only made to seem complicated through financial language. Secondly, understanding the importance of connecting with the right people, online or IRL who can give you all the information you need about the business you are entering. Finally, Codie believes that we never actually sell anyone anything or convince them to do anything, but instead you connect with what people are already truly feeling.

      <title>Moment 136: 3 VITAL Questions To Ask Yourself If You're Feeling Trapped In Life (Relationships, Work &amp; Financially): Adam Alter</title>
      <description>In this moment, professor of marketing and best-selling author, Adam Alter discusses how to become unstuck in life, work and relationships. The first thing is to understand what it actually means to become stuck, this often means judging whether to keep going with a particular path or to quit. In these instances Adam thinks it is best to think about the opportunity cost of leaving a goal behind, especially as research shows that it is nearly always a good idea to keep going beyond the point where it starts becoming hard as this is where growth happens. However, too often we quit as we view any sort of difficultly as a problem. One of the key ways that Adam thinks we can become unstuck is by simplifying a problem as much as possible, we can do this through what he calls a friction audit. This means knowing what is and isn’t important, what’s getting in the way, and how you can subtract it.

In this new episode Steven sits down again with leading neuroscientist, Dr. Tali Sharot.

Dr. Tali Sharot is the director of the Affective Brain Lab and Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London.

Ways to break the feeling of being in a repetitive cycle

Why people become immune to joy

How to see what you’ve always missed

How to have the best holiday

Why you should take a break from your partner to improve your relationship

How to keep a relationship spicey

Why humans need the feeling of being in control

The secrets of motivation

Why the midlife crisis is real and the ways to beat it

How VR can help people overcome fear

Why happiness is low in midlife

How to increase productivity

Why humans get bored of happiness

Why the idea of living your best life doesn’t exist

Why people need to disrupt their life

How to increase your levels of happiness

Why 40% of people quit a new job

How to use change to improve your life

The ways that social media is like prison

Why social media is ruining expectations

Ways to make people believe you

How changing incentives can change your life

Why Gen Z will change the world

People becoming addicted to risk

Why risk can help get rid of anxiety

      <title>Moment 135: Master The Art Of Controlling That Negative Voice: Yung Pueblo </title>
      <description>In this moment, bestselling poet and author, Yung Pueblo discusses his mission in raising self-awareness and making people realise that healing is possible. When he was younger he believed that if you were sick mentally it was just something you had to deal with for life, however by radically changing himself through meditation and a different environment, he realised that healing is necessary to living a better life. Over time the difficult moments in our past build up in our mind, and we repeat cycles of thought and behaviour, healing allows us the freedom to escape this. However, Yung Pueblo believes the biggest challenge is that people doubt their own power and don’t understand their capacity, distracting themselves from their emotions. Instead we need to sit and embrace these difficult emotions that make us feel uncomfortable and be radically honest with ourself.

      <title>The Anti-Ageing Expert: "I Have The Erection Of An 18 Year Old!", "This Food Reverses Your Age!", "This Oil Reduces Inflammation by 85%!"</title>
      <description>Can we slow down ageing? Could we even reverse it? And, is death potentially optional?

In this new episode Steven sits down again with entrepreneur, anti-aging and longevity pioneer Bryan Johnson.

In 2007, Bryan founded the payment processing company ‘Braintree’, and was soon 47th on Inc. magazine’s list of the fastest growing companies in America. Bryan sold Braintree in 2013 for $800 million. Since then he founded ‘Project Blueprint’ in 2021. ‘Blueprint’ is an algorithmic approach to optimal health and ageing reversal, Bryan is their first test subject.

In this conversation Bryan and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Fighting against depression for a decade in his early 20’s

Wondering whether life was worth living

Struggling to balance religion, marriage, and depression.

Trying to find ways to overcome depression

How he was able to find freedom

Breaking free from a toxic relationship

The algorithm that controls human behaviour

The impact of negative self-talk

Understanding his self-destructive tendencies

His daily battles against harmful actions

Confronting death

How humans are self-sabotaging

Recognising society's illness and self-harm.

Why there is a collective existential crisis

Why driving is the most dangerous act

The impact of sleep

Why it is possible for humans to live forever

How he will live to 125 years old

Why olive oil reverses ageing

How he is tricking his DNA to reverse ageing

Why he is measuring his night time erections

      <title>The Savings Expert: “Do Not Buy A House!”, How To Turn £100 Into £1.5m Without Effort: Morgan Housel</title>
      <description>Will money make you happy? How much is really enough? And how much should you save? Too often people don’t have the answers for the biggest financial questions in life, until now.
In this new episode Steven sits down with world-renowned financial expert and best-selling author, Morgan Housel.
Morgan Housel is a partner at the Collaborative Fund, a leading venture capital firm with a focus on technological companies. He is also the author of the book, ‘The Psychology of Money’, which has sold over 4 million copies. MarketWatch named him as one of 2022’s 50 most influential people in financial markets.

In this conversation Morgan and Steven discuss topics, such as:

How happiness is being in control and having freedom

Why a lack of control can make your life crumble

Why nobody actually cares about your material possessions

The money games being played in society

Why you should rent your home until you have kids

His mission behind writing about money

Why your relationship with money defines you

How to gain introspection about your life and finances

The randomness of financial crises

Why you should have a deathbed perspective on work and savings

How embrace failure can lead to huge successes

The double life of billionaires: wealth and pressure

The cost of a stressful job on health

Why bad news travels faster

Why growth comes from challenges and disasters

How growth comes with stress and uncertainty

Slow habits and their long term effects

How personal tragedies shape life goals

Why you should balance wealth with wellbeing

Staying patient despite market upheavals

The need for big, terrifying goals in business.

The difference between being rich and feeling wealthy.

Why a rising income doesn’t lead to happiness

The meaning of authentic success

What is meant by healthy discomfort

How 2% of people are willing to push beyond their comfort zones

The difference between being lonely and alone

The benefits of being alone

But the negative impacts of being lonely

Why loneliness is a killer

How to make better long term decisions

Why people with higher status live longer

How noisy cities cause heart attacks and depression

How to fix back pain

The ways that taking the stairs will improve your health

Why the world is becoming increasingly unhappy

How activity in nature is better for your brain

Why our ancestor were so much fitter than us

How we’ve engineered meaning out of our lives

      <title>Moment 133: Behaviour Change Scientist Reveals A Simple Solution To Imposter Syndrome: Shahroo Izadi</title>
      <description>In this moment, behavioural change specialist Shahroo Izadi discusses how to overcome imposter syndrome. Shahroo defines imposter syndrome as not being able to internalise your accomplishments, so that even the most successful people never feel as if they are enough. This is all linked to low self-worth, shame and guilt, coming from not being able to give yourself permission to accept that what others made find easy you find difficult. As you will need to change habits your whole life, Shahroo believes that you need to change the conversations you have with yourself, feeling smart, calm and proud of yourself so that you can reframe challenges to opportunities for showing your capacity.

      <itunes:summary>In this moment, behavioural change specialist Shahroo Izadi discusses how to overcome imposter syndrome. Shahroo defines imposter syndrome as not being able to internalise your accomplishments, so that even the most successful people never feel as if they are enough. This is all linked to low self-worth, shame and guilt, coming from not being able to give yourself permission to accept that what others made find easy you find difficult. As you will need to change habits your whole life, Shahroo believes that you need to change the conversations you have with yourself, feeling smart, calm and proud of yourself so that you can reframe challenges to opportunities for showing your capacity.

Why people are so addicted to f**k boys

The importance of taking a break during a fight

Understanding our dating patterns and how we can change them

The secretary problem and the maths of when to stop looking and choose someone

      <title>Moment 132: Triple Your Life Expectancy With These 3 Health Hacks! (Verified By Dana White): Gary Brecka</title>
      <description>In this moment, Human Biologist and Biohacker, Gary Brecka discusses how he tripled Dana White’s life expectancy, and how you can increase yours. Gary describes the President of the UFC, Dana White, as just one more example of someone who had given up on their ability to thrive. This included carrying too much weight, waking up sore and being over medicated. Starting from a life threatening alert on Dana’s blood work, in 10 weeks Gary was able to change Dana’s life around, and by the end of 5 months he was off every medication, lost 40 pounds and said that he had no idea that he could feel as good as he did. Gary says that you can copy these amazing results with 3 simple steps: breath work, connecting to the surface of the earth, and become comfortable with being uncomfortable.

      <title>Doctor Gabor Mate: I Regret My Interview With Prince Harry! The Shocking Link Between Kindness &amp; Illness!</title>
      <description>Being nice is bad for your health, while being angry is healthy, Dr. Gabor Mate unpacks the inner depths that lie beneath the personality you show to the world.

In this new episode Steven sits down again with world-renowned trauma and addiction expert, Dr. Gabor Mate.

Dr. Gabor Mate is a physician and an expert on addiction, stress and childhood development. For 12 years, Gabor worked in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside with patients challenged by drug addiction, mental illness and HIV. He has over 20 years of family practice and palliative care experience. His books include: ‘When the Body Says No’, ‘In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction’ and most recently, ‘The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness &amp; Healing in a Toxic Culture’.

In this conversation Gabor and Steven discuss topics, such as:

His tough year

His biggest self-criticisms

Why you don't have to identify with emotions

The importance of saying ‘no’

Why he can't follow his own advice

Losing himself with success

His interview with Prince Harry

Why he regrets this interview

What he learned about Prince Harry

How Prince Harry was a traumatised child

The importance of asking for help

The need to reconnect to our gut feelings

Why gut feelings are everything

How we play out our traumas

Why women take the pain for both partners in a couple

Always wanting to design his own world

Wanting to escape his childhood

His work addiction

Working as a way of finding love

How success is isolating

What no one told him about success

The need to fight to be connected with people

Why success won't fix you

How Obama changed his life

The life changing impact of one text message

His biggest regret

The impact of Walt Disney upon him

How creativity changes the world

Airbnb initially just being a way to pay the rent

How creativity beats data

Why more companies need creativity and heart

Why company culture is everything

The importance of leaders as examples

How your worst moments define you

Airbnb’s fight for survival

What he learned about true happiness

The world’s loneliness pandemic

      <title>Spotify Founder: “Spotify Was A Stupid Idea!” How A 23 Year Old Shy, Underdog, Introvert, Built A $31 Billion Business! - Daniel Ek</title>
      <description>How to go from the Swedish housing projects to billionaire CEO of Spotify.
In this new episode Steven sits down with the co-founder and CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek.
Daniel Ek is a Swedish entrepreneur who started his first company in 1997 at just 14 years old. He eventually dropped out of college and founded the online marketing firm, Advertigo, which he sold in 2006 to the Swedish company Tradedoubler at 23 years old. Coming out of early retirement, Daniel founded Spotify alongside Martin Lorentzon in 2006.

In this conversation Daniel and Steven discuss topics, such as:

His childhood in a single parent household

The importance of his mother in his success

Growing up in the Swedish projects

Coming from a musical family

Overcoming being an introvert

His ability to adapt to changing situations

Not fitting in when he was growing up

How his difference helped in his later success

Starting his first company while at school

How people worry more about failing then succeeding

Why effort can’t always beat talent

People not understanding what it’s actually like to be a billionaire

How spare time is now his most important currency

Why the idea of success through University is outdated

What football taught him about business

Retiring at 23 years old

Why he found being rich and successful depressing

How the idea of ‘why-not’ helped to create Spotify

Realising that he had approached his career in the wrong way

How Spotify nearly collapsed 4 times

The importance of culture in organisations

Why you should take the risk of betting on yourself

      <title>Moment 127: How To Build Unbreakable Confidence By Making This ONE Promise To Yourself: Chris Williamson</title>
      <description>In this moment, YouTuber and podcaster Chris Williamson gives his best advice for building confidence. Chris believes that the most important step for achieving confidence is to lead with action. Acting first is more important than starting with positive thinking, as this positivity can easily be crushed by negativity. To being on the road to confidence, you should start with an incredibly small step and easy promises that you will never break. Chris says that little by little these small steps will compound until you have undeniable proof of past actions that you can feel truly proud and confident for achieving.

      <title>Moment 126: How To Master The Consistency Of Achieving Your Goals &amp; Sticking To Them: Nir Eyal</title>
      <description>In this moment, the behavioural design and productivity expert, Nir Eyal discusses how the belief that you only have a limited amount of willpower is actually a self-limiting myth. Instead, using scientific studies Nir shows that willpower is a limitless resource. Similarly, Nir says the single factor for why you don’t achieve your goals is from the emotion of not feeling like doing the gradual work it takes to accomplish them. It is because of this that you quit and fail. To prevent this, Nir believes you should act now with the same attributes and values you would want in your future self, the future you that has achieved these targets and goals.

      <title>Google DeepMind Co-founder: AI Could Release A Deadly Virus - It’s Getting More Threatening! Mustafa Suleyman</title>
      <description>Mustafa Suleyman went from growing up next to a prison to founding the world's leading AI company. Dropping out of Oxford to start a philanthropic endeavour because he thought it would be of more real-world value than a degree, he went on to co-found DeepMind, which has since been acquired by Google and is leading their AI effort. 
In 2016, DeepMind gained worldwide fame for programming the first AI program to defeat the world champion of Go, considered the most complicated game in the world and with infinitely more variables than chess. There is no better authority on the progress of AI and what it means for all of us. His new book, 'The Coming Wave,' is out on September 5th.
In this conversation Mustafa and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Emotional Responses to AI

Surprises of the Past Decade

Concerns and Fears

The Containment Challenge

AI's Physical Manifestations

Regulating AI

The Future of AI Containment

AI-Human Interactions

Quantum Computing and AI

Cybersecurity Challenges

Founding an AI Company

Government's Role in Regulation

Containing AI: Strategies and Approaches

Emotional Impact of AI

The Shift Towards AI Interactions

Guidance for Young Innovators

Success and Failure Scenarios

Continuation of the Conversation

In 2016, DeepMind gained worldwide fame for programming the first AI program to defeat the world champion of Go, considered the most complicated game in the world and with infinitely more variables than chess. There is no better authority on the progress of AI and what it means for all of us. His new book, 'The Coming Wave,' is out on September 5th.
In this conversation Mustafa and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Emotional Responses to AI

Surprises of the Past Decade

Concerns and Fears

The Containment Challenge

AI's Physical Manifestations

Regulating AI

The Future of AI Containment

AI-Human Interactions

Quantum Computing and AI

Cybersecurity Challenges

Founding an AI Company

Government's Role in Regulation

Containing AI: Strategies and Approaches

Emotional Impact of AI

      <title>Moment 125: The Marketing Professor: The Biggest Business Mistake You’re Probably Making Without Realising It</title>
      <description>In this moment, the advertising and marketing expert Rory Sutherland, discusses the number one curse of modern businesses. Rory believes that too many companies are following the false goal of finding the perfect measurement of spending to outcome. This can led to companies obsessing over what can be measured and underinvesting on the things that really matter but are hard to quantify, this can include fundamental targets such as customer loyalty and repeat purchasing. A further flaw in this way of thinking is that all data that leads these decisions comes from the past, which means there is a limit on what big data can tell you about future spending.

      <title>Ivan Toney: I’m Finally Ready To Speak! The Truth About His Football Ban And His Future Team!</title>
      <description>He has previously said that he would “speak soon with no filter”, for Ivan Toney that time is now.

In this new episode Steven sits down with footballer Ivan Toney. Ivan started his football career in 2012 playing for Northampton Town at 16 years old, and 3 years later moved into the Premier League with Newcastle United. After 4 appearances with Newcastle United, he spent the next few years on loan to various clubs. However, in 2018 Ivan began to build his reputation as a top striker when he joined Peterborough United, scoring 49 goals in 94 appearances. In 2020, Ivan signed with Brentford, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season. In November 2022, the FA charged Ivan with 232 counts of breaching betting rules between 2017 and 2021, he was fined £50,000 and banned from playing professional football until 17 January 2024.

In this conversation Ivan and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Finding football at a young age

The brutal playing style of the lower leagues

His father’s belief that he would be a top footballer

The advice Ivan would give to his younger self

When he began gambling

The impact that rejection by teams had on him

His journey in football being a constant climb

How moving to the Premier League changed his mindset

Mixing with the wrong crowd when in the Premier League

Not feeling as if he was given the chance to prove himself early in his career

Taking chances and becoming a top goal scorer

Becoming a father at a young age and its impact on him

Advice that he would give to his children if they wanted to become footballers

Why Brentford is so special and it’s superpower as a team

The mentality that management instils at Brentford

The importance of having self belief

His gambling addiction

How he believes that FA made an example out of him

Why he was not match fixing

His lowest point during his playing ban

Being denied entry to a restaurant because of the allegations against him

Seeing this chapter of his life as a learning moment

How young footballers not being given advice on how to spend their money wisely

The racist abuse he has received

Why he stopped taking the knee before matches

How he plans to be scoring goals in January 2024

      <title>Doctor Joe Dispenza: Your Thoughts Are Making You Sick! You MUST Do This Before 10am To Fix It!</title>
      <description>Joe’s best selling books, such as "You Are the Placebo" and "Becoming Supernatural" have helped thousands understand the science and the potential of untapped capabilities within their bodies to supercharge their health. His work emphasises the importance of meditation and mental rehearsal in creating positive change and mind and body ‘cohesiveness’, revolutionising how people can see health and wellness as one and the same thing. If you have been looking for a ‘kick’ to make positive changes in your life, Joe provides not just a method of how to do it, but how to stop making excuses not to do it. In this conversation Joe and Steven discuss topics, such as: How to take personal responsibility How we become addicted to our negative emotions How to turn destructive habits into constructive ones How your beliefs are the limit on yourselves The habit we need to break is being yourself Your beliefs are your limitation How you become addicted to your negative emotions How 95% of what we do is programmed How habits can work for or against you How you can recreate your reality How you can become addicted to guilt How to show up as the person you want to be How your thoughts can make you feel sick How your thoughts can help you heal How we always wait for something external to change so we can change How to be a creator of your life, not a victim of your life How to teach your body how to feel How the worst things that happen to you are often the best things How your mind can heal your body

      <title>Moment 122: The Unseen And Horrifying Knock On Effect Of Dating Apps On Our Society - Scott Galloway</title>
      <description>In this moment, professor and author Scott Galloway discusses how technology has taken over dating and the impact of this. Traditionally, a third of couples met via work, another third through friends and a final third at school, however dating apps have completely taken over the dating market. This change to dating has had dramatic impacts specifically for young men, as the men who are in the top 10% of attractiveness attract 90% of female attention. This has led Scott to the belief that online dating has been great for the top 10% of attractive men, OK for the top 50% and a total disaster for bottom 50%. These bottom 50% of men are effectively shut out of the dating market and can have devastating impacts for society.

      <title>Moment 121: "This ONE Small Thing Makes Me So Grateful That I Cry!" - Fearne Cotton</title>
      <description>In this moment, the broadcaster, writer and founder of Happy Place, Fearne Cotton discusses how we can find meaning through connection in our confusing world.

The reason that stepping outside of yourself is crucial, is that it removes your feelings of self-importance that can separate you from the connections all around you.

      <title>Moment 120: The ONE Skill, We Can All Learn, That 95% of Millionaires Have!: Alex Hormozi</title>
      <description>In this moment the entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist Alex Hormozi gives his best advice for becoming a millionaire. According to Alex there are many ways to reach this level of success, but it is dependent upon the person on which path they want to take to become a millionaire. This can either come from creating a business around a core skill or working with other people to combine their skills into a unified organisation. Alex believes that one of the keys to personal development and success is the idea of skill stacking. This is the adding of different skills on top of an original skill, until you reach a level of having a completely unique and valuable skillset.

TSS is a life-threatening complication from bacterial infections, and due to infection both of Lauren’s legs were amputated. 3 years after being just 10 minutes from death, Lauren made her return to modelling at 27 years old in her now trademark golden legs. She now works to educate and raise awareness about the impact of TSS. In this conversation Lauren and Steven discuss topics, such as: The day that her life changed forever How a tampon nearly killed her Losing her leg at 24 years old Her struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts Finding her confidence again Her return to modelling How her golden legs became her statement piece Finding her purpose in tackling Toxic Shock Syndrome The information that everyone should hear You can learn more about Toxic Shock Syndrome here: https://bit.ly/3O1Lu92 You can also learn more about the impact of TSS on the people who have lost loved ones due to the syndrome, here: https://bit.ly/43KouB4 Follow Lauren: Instagram: https://bit.ly/3rOB3yk Twitter: https://bit.ly/44DkrYF Watch the episodes on Youtube - https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb My new book!

      <title>Moment 119: How To Figure Out ANYTHING In Your Life: Marie Forleo</title>
      <description>In this moment, entrepreneur and author of ‘Everything is Figureoutable’, Marie Forleo discusses her 3 rules for a Figureoutable mindset. The most important of these rules is her third rule, which says that if you don’t care enough to reach a dream or goal, that’s OK, and instead you should find another dream or goal. Too often in life we beat ourselves up for being unmotivated or lazy for not achieving certain targets. Actually, we should just admit that we don’t care enough about the goal, and it is just something we think we should want to achieve. Instead, Marie believes we should reexamine our priorities and understand the difference when we say we ‘can’t’ or ‘won’t’ do something, as 99 percent of the time when we say we ‘can’t ‘we mean we won’t or don’t want to.

      <title>Moment 118 - The Ultimate Gift YOU Should Be Offering Each &amp; Every Friend: Simon Sinek</title>
      <description>In this moment, the best selling author and inspirational speaker, Simon Sinek, discusses the honour of being able to serve a friend in need, why people are having quarter life crises and why we should ignore the targets set by social expectations. Simon believes that more often than not when people are in a crisis they don’t want solutions but for some to let them vent and sit in the mud with them. He also discusses how too many young people are worried about wasting time in their careers and life, trying to keep pace with arbitrary targets set by societal standards.

      <title>Moment 117 - The Unexpected Power Of Seduction: Robert Greene</title>
      <description>In this moment, the bestselling author Robert Greene discusses how seduction is a high form of power that can make people do what you want without them realising it. Seduction does this by using pleasure and excitement to reduce people’s resistance to your ideas. Robert also breaks down the qualities of a great seducer, including being outer directed towards other people, a great listener and giving someone attention and a feeling of recognition. Finally, Robert explains why vulnerability is seductive and insecurity is not. While insecurity is self-absorbed, vulnerability is an openness to another person and the world.

      <title>Moment 116 - The ONE Type Of Trauma You Cannot Heal From: Professor Steven Peters</title>
      <description>In this moment, the psychiatrist and author of ‘The Chimp Paradox’, Professor Steve Peters, discusses how there are some early childhood traumas that simply can’t be erased.

However Professor Peters believes that it is critical we divide traumas between those you can tackle and others that you have to learn to live and deal with. If we don’t accept that there are some problems that can’t be solved it can actually cause more distress, not only to the people suffering the trauma but even to their therapists and partners.

      <title>Moment 113 - Why You're Not Having Sex &amp; How To Get It Back: Jay Shetty</title>
      <description>If you go onto social media or talk with friends it seems that everyone is having sex, however if you look at the statistics it seems that sex is at an all time low. In this moment, ex-monk and relationship guru, Jay Shetty discusses why there is a rise in sexless relationships and marriages, going for months or even years without sexual intimacy. To bring back sex, Jay says that we need to regain intimacy in relationships, through open and honest conversations, as sex is a byproduct of connection and intimacy, rather than a source of it.

However, what remained stable during this time was his position as a business leader and the trust that things will improve, you just have to keep showing up. Looking back, John believes it is important to remember that we end up being grateful for the worst periods in our life, as they end up making us into the people we are.

      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with the Canadian entrepreneur and President of Shopify, Harley Finkelstein.
Harley was 17 years when we started his first company selling T-shirts at University.

Since then Harley has helped Shopify grow from a start-up to one of the world’s leading e-commerce platforms in the world, powering over 1 million businesses in 175 countries.
In this conversation Harley and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Harley’s mission to make more people into entrepreneurs

      <title>Moment 108 - This Powerful Tool Can Change Your Life: Africa Brooke</title>
      <description>In this moment Africa Brooke discusses the importance of accountability and how taking responsibility is the opposite of self-sabotage. From her own past experiences, Africa knows that it is all too easy to externalise and place the blame outside of yourself. This is a way of avoiding self reflecting and truly examining the role you play in the decisions and negative outcomes in your life. However, the opposite is also true that we always have the ability and power to change even the smallest part of our circumstances for the better.

      <title>Macklemore: How I Destroyed My Addiction &amp; Overcame My Darkest Times</title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with the American rapper and songwriter Macklemore.
Ben Haggerty adopted the stage name of Macklemore when he began rapping at the age of 14, at the same time he was beginning his struggle with substance abuse. Ben released his debut album, ‘The Language of My World’, in 2005. However, his struggles with addiction threaten to halt his musical career and he entered rehab in 2008. He started collaborating with the producer Ryan Lewis in 2009 and the pair released their album, ‘The Heist’, in 2012. This album went on to win 4 Grammy Awards and become platinum certified. Since 2017, Ben has focused on his solo career, releasing the album ‘Gemini’ and launching his golf-inspired clothing brand Bogey Boys in 2021. He has just released his third solo album, ‘Ben’.
In this conversation Ben and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Ben’s struggle with addiction and relapsing

How to be there for someone struggling with the disease of addiction

Knowing the difference between what you want in the moment vs in the long term

Removing your ego and being present during the creative process

The double edged sword of social media

      <title>Moment 107 - Why Counting Calories Doesn't Work: Tim Spector</title>
      <description>In this moment Dr Tim Spector unravels the myth of calorie counting for health and weight loss. Dr Spector discusses how dieting is not just a simple case of tracking calories in compared to calories, as it is nearly impossible for even professionals to accurately count calories.

      <description>In this moment, Lewis Howes discusses the biggest killer of relationships.

Since then, Chris has been on a constant mission to evolve and follow his ceaseless curiosity. He has used his podcast as his own university degree, talking to the world’s preeminent thinkers and learning alongside his listeners.
In this expansive conversation Chris discusses everything from strategies in the fight against imposter syndrome and gaining confidence, the true price of success and what drives successful people, to the game of love and relationships in the modern world.

      <description>Alex Hormozi knows all about the highs and lows of the journey to becoming successful.

      <description>Are you free or do you just think that you are free? Are you in fact trapped by your past and every reaction you make shaped by your history? In this moment Dr Gabor Mate discusses how trauma can become a puppet master controlling every aspect of your life and even lead to addiction as a coping mechanism to avoid pain. To overcome this Dr Mate believes you must become aware of your trauma and make it your friend rather than your master, because the opposite of trauma is liberation.

      <title>Alex Cooper: The World's No.1 Female Podcaster Finally Opens Up! (Call Her Daddy) </title>
      <description>You can call her daddy but you can also call her Alex Cooper. You could call her Father Cooper the podcaster, or you could call her Alexandra Cooper, the head of a multimillion dollar brand. No matter what you call her Alex defies labelling and expectations.
But before she was the media mastermind signing multi-million dollar contracts, she was learning the lessons that would help her become the industry leader she is now. Whether that was perfecting her craft of content creation or learning radical empathy from her psychologist mother, these have all been used in her unmatched interviews with the world’s biggest celebrities.
In this expansive conversation Alex discusses her journey to becoming Daddy. From overcoming childhood bullying and self-doubt, hustling and taking advantage of every opportunity that presented itself, Alex has grown and evolved into the icon she is today and taken her devoted Daddy Gang along for the ride.

      <title>Tony Hawk: The Man With The $1.4 Billion Name! Burnout, Obsession &amp; Regrets</title>
      <description>If you think about skateboarding, there is one name that will pop up in your mind: Tony Hawk. It’s the same name that fronts a billion dollar video game franchise. He has been called the Michael Jordan of skateboarding, and at the height of his career he was so dominant in competition that the real fight was for second place.
But before skateboarding became the Olympic sport it is today and Tony the living legend that he is, he was an outsider in a sport for outsiders. Driven by his love of skateboarding and to prove his haters wrong, he created an entirely new path for the sport and brought it into the public light and popularity it has today.
In this conversation Tony discusses his life’s dedication to skateboarding, the highs and lows that this commitment brings and how the sport has given back to him by teaching him lessons that he has used in both life and business.

      <title>Moment 102 - Why A Job Isn't Just A Paycheck: Barbara Corcoran </title>
      <description>What is the value of a job? Is it just the pay check or is there something more valuable that can be gained from a job?

      <title>Robert Greene: How To Seduce Anyone, Build Confidence &amp; Become Powerful</title>
      <description>How do you achieve success in the modern world? This is the billion dollar question. Some people would say that you must gain a whole new variety of skills and knowledge to keep up in our fast moving times. Only a few people would say you should use strategies that haven’t changed in thousands of years, as human nature and the game of power hasn’t changed either.
Best-selling author Robert Greene is one of these few people. Ever since he was a child he has been fascinated with seeing behind the polite masks that humans show to each other in civilised society, whilst underneath these disguises we all share a darker side and cravings for power.
In this enlightening conversation Robert Greene discusses his life’s work, from the rules of power and seduction, to mastery and human nature. Robert explores how we can use the lessons of history to succeed in all areas of life.

      <title>Simon Sinek: Opens Up About His Struggle with Loneliness, Love, Dating!</title>
      <description>What is the greatest way that you can spend your time on earth? Or in other words, what is your ‘why’? For too many of us we answer that question by saying all the things that we hope we will gain and achieve, rather than the ways that we help others and make their life better.
As Simon Sinek says there are entire sections of book shops dedicated to self-help but none dedicated to helping others, and we aren’t taught in school how to listen or the value of being a good friend. In fact it seems one of the radical acts you can do in the modern world is to live a life of service.
In this conversation with Simon at his most vulnerable he discusses everything from love and relationships, quarter life crises and why you should never cry alone. As with every discussion with Simon, this will have you rethinking everything you previously thought you knew.

      <title>Seth Rogen Opens Up About His Self-Doubt &amp; Struggles That Nobody Sees!</title>
      <description>Seth Rogen is a comedian, writer, director and producer whose films have together grossed $2.8 billion at the box office. In comedy since he was 12 years old, it’s all he’s ever known, and he’s one of the biggest comedy forces on the planet.
Podcast description:
Seth Rogen is a comedian, writer, director and producer whose films have together grossed $2.8 billion at the box office. In comedy since he was 12 years old, it’s all he’s ever known, and he’s one of the biggest comedy forces on the planet.
Opening up for the first time on the dementia diagnosis that tore his family apart, as well as the toll that bad reviews can do to the people who make films, Seth is a good guy trying to make his way in an industry that famously rewards bad behaviour. He tells us what that’s really like.
For many people, Seth provided the narration for their adolescence with iconic, classic movies like Superbad and Pineapple Express - hilariously mining his own fumbles on his journey into adulthood for comic effect. Now, through his weed company Houseplant, he takes people on a journey of a different source as the supplier of one of the most popular suppliers of legal weed in North America.
Seth’s personal essay collection, Yearbook, is available March 7th: https://www.amazon.com/Yearbook-Seth-Rogen/

      <title>Moment 99 - Simon Sinek: The Power Of Your ‘Why’ &amp; How To Find It!</title>
      <description>What is your why? It is the reason you wake up in the morning, it is your value and the thing you give to the world and the people around you. In this moment Simon Sinek discusses how your ‘why’ is formed by the time you are a teenager and is the sum total of your upbringing and how you were raised. Once formed your ‘why’ never changes. But Simon says the thing we give to the world with our ‘why’ is also the thing we need the most, to find this we need to focus less on ourselves and focus on helping others.

      <title>E226: Zara Larsson: How To Stop Caring What Others Think! </title>
      <description>Zara Larsson is an international singer song writer, amassing over 8 billion streams across all major streaming platforms. Since she won a national televised talent contest in her native Sweden aged 10, Zara has always wanted to be ‘bigger than Elvis’ and ‘more famous than Beyonce’. Saying the goal is ambitious is understating it, but she’s single-mindedly pursued it ever since. Chasing the top for Zara is a way of chasing life. Outspoken about her beliefs and uncompromising in her art - for Zara there are no half-measures and no shortcuts. She’s in the game to be the best. Zara is promoting her new single, ‘Can’t tame her’, which is out now. Her new album is nearly ready, too. In one of the most honest conversations we’ve had with a major public figure, Zara certainly doesn’t hold back on how she got to where she is, and where she’s headed next… Topics: Intro Early years Desire to be famous Pressure as an artist Ambitions Life under the microscope Your struggles Being scared of death Public validation Being treated badly by men Advice to people who look up to you Your new album What does success look like for you in 10 years?

      <title>Moment 98 - The One Thing All Successful Leaders Have (And You Can Too!): Whitney Wolf Herd</title>
      <description>With everything that has changed in the world, from the internet to the pandemic, what does this mean for the idea of leadership and being the perfect leader? In this moment Whitney Wolfe Herd discusses how for her a leader is the conductor creating harmony among a noisy orchestra. For Whitney, this means ignoring the examples of past leaders that were more like tyrants rather than bosses, and instead to listen to your gut and lead with compassion. It is only by being open and truly vulnerable that we can connect with the people around us and as leaders get the best out of our people.

      <title>Behaviour Change Scientist: How I Lost 120lbs With Kindness: Shahroo Izadi</title>
      <description>If your friend tells you about a new goal they want to achieve, would you tell them that there is no way they can do it, or that it wasn’t for people like them? Of course you wouldn’t! But why is it that so many of us speak to ourselves in this way?
If you really want to change your habits for good, behaviour change specialist Shahroo Izadi believes that this self-talk is what is holding you back from the real change you want to achieve. Instead, Shahroo believes we have to treat ourselves with kindness to create lasting difference.
In this necessary conversation Shahroo breaks down her kindness method and how her own life influenced it, from her work as an addiction therapist to the struggles in her personal life. If you want to change any habit in your life for good, this episode is essential for you!

      <title>Richard Hammond: The heartbreaking conversation that I am STILL avoiding!</title>
      <description>Lying in a weeks long coma after being involved in a car crash at 300 miles per hour, you may wonder about the life path that led Richard Hammond to that hospital bed and the personality behind his miraculous recovery.
From a short school boy desperate for attention to one of the nations favourite trio of petrol heads, Richard has always been either driven or driving. Despite labelling himself just a very lucky guy and thinking success was for other people, his infectious enthusiasm has made him a national icon.
In this wide ranging conversation Richard discusses everything from why Top Gear was the success it was, what he saw on the brink of death, and why cars have always had such a deep emotional appeal to him.

      <title>Moment 96 - Without This You WON'T Find Fulfilment In Life: Stephen Fry</title>
      <description>How many times have you said that you will finally be happy at some future date or when you have achieved some far off goal? Only once you reach that future time or accomplish that goal you aren’t happy? In this moment Stephen Fry discusses how we madly chase for complex things that we think will make us happy or indulge in fake happiness, all the while ignoring the simple things right in front of us that give true joy. Stephen says that our feelings of self worth and fulfilment ultimately come from the way we treat other people.

      <title>Romesh Ranganathan: There's A Dark Voice In My Head That I've Learnt To Control</title>
      <description>From a maths teacher and occasional rapper to one of the UK’s most popular comedians, you would think this was the set up to one of Romesh Ranganathan’s typically deadpan jokes. However, as is the case with most comedians behind the jokes and laughter lies pain.
After bursting onto our screens Romesh has been constantly working always afraid that his success could slip out from under him at any second, stemming from his family struggles as a teenager when his father was sent to prison and life as he knew it fell apart.
In this hilarious but also intimate conversation Romesh discusses the life experiences that have provided him the endless material for his sell out shows but also the challenges that have made him the man he is today.

      <title>The "Happy Life" Scientist: How To FINALLY Beat Stress, Worry &amp; Uncertainty! Dacher Keltner</title>
      <description>When was the last time something took your breath away, or left you speechless? Awe is something that is hard to put into words and understand for yourself, let alone scientifically examine. However this is exactly what Dr Dacher Keltner has dedicated his career to.
As a psychology professor Dr Dacher is dedicated to the study of emotions and happiness, in his groundbreaking research he believes that awe, the feeling when you see something beyond your understanding, can have huge impacts on both your brain and body.
In this eye opening conversation Dacher discusses just what it means to live a good life, our need for connection, and his personally journey from tragedy and despair to finding and spreading the awe of everyday life.

      <title>The Weight Loss Scientist: You've Been LIED To About Calories, Dieting &amp; Losing Weight: Giles Yeo</title>
      <description>Have you tried every diet under the sun but can’t seem to budge the weight, or if you have lost the weight as soon as you stop the diet you put it all back on? What if weight loss had nothing to do with discipline and self control, but your brain was actually designed to want you to be fat?
This is something that Cambridge University Professor Giles Yeo has been researching all through his career, how the brain controls our bodyweight. Dr Yeo examines how our genes have evolved over time to make us crave certain foods, and why people can have totally different relationships with food.
After watching this conversation you won’t see food the same way again, as Dr Yeo exposes why calories shouldn’t be counted, why most diets are the same and unsustainable in the long term and how you can lose weight without losing your love of food.

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you tried every diet under the sun but can’t seem to budge the weight, or if you have lost the weight as soon as you stop the diet you put it all back on? What if weight loss had nothing to do with discipline and self control, but your brain was actually designed to want you to be fat?</p><p>This is something that Cambridge University Professor Giles Yeo has been researching all through his career, how the brain controls our bodyweight. Dr Yeo examines how our genes have evolved over time to make us crave certain foods, and why people can have totally different relationships with food.</p><p>After watching this conversation you won’t see food the same way again, as Dr Yeo exposes why calories shouldn’t be counted, why most diets are the same and unsustainable in the long term and how you can lose weight without losing your love of food.</p><p><br></p><p>Giles:</p><p> Twitter -</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3Y9IZF0">https://bit.ly/3Y9IZF0</a></p><p>Instagram -</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3Rs5bIj">https://bit.ly/3Rs5bIj</a></p><p>Giles’ books: Why Calories Don’t Count -</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3XWPtaL">https://bit.ly/3XWPtaL</a></p><p>Gene Eating -</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/3Yc37X6">https://bit.ly/3Yc37X6</a></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>David Moyes Reveals The Truth About Managing The Worlds Greatest Teams</title>
      <description>As he would tell you himself, the football is in David Moyes’s blood. Growing up in Glasgow he was surrounded by the game, from his dad coaching to his mum washing the kits, this devotion has continued to now.
Making the jump from player to manager, David has seen every side and evolution of football, and not all of it was pretty. From the highs of being handpicked by the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson as the manager of Manchester United to the lows of his very public sacking, and his miraculous return as ‘The Moyesiah’.
In this conversation David speaks about what it takes to become one of the world’s best known managers, the winning habits and values he instills in his teams and why he is constantly renewing himself for the game he loves.

      <title>Derren Brown: UNLOCK The Secret Power Of Your Mind! </title>
      <description>Predicting the lottery, playing Russian roulette on live TV and tricking people into robbing a security van in broad daylight. These are just a few of the stunts that Derren Brown has performed in over 20 years of pushing the boundaries of the believable.
But while he may be best known for controlling minds, one he couldn’t control was his own. From battling with issues of self esteem, faith and coming to terms with his sexuality, Derren’s path to success has been one that is both internal and in the limelight.
In this intimate conversation with Britain’s alternative national treasure, Derren breaks the magician’s code and reveals his secrets, as well as the psychological tricks we play on ourselves and hold us back from our true potential.

      <title>No.1 Neuroscientist: Age 30 to 50 Will Be Your Unhappiest, Here's How To FIX IT! - Dr. Tali Sharot</title>
      <description>Is the cup of life half full or half empty? Would you call yourself an optimist or a pessimist? What if you weren’t actually in control of this, but instead through the process of evolution your brain had been hardwired to be optimistic?
Neuroscientist Dr. Tali Sharot calls this the ‘Optimism Bias’, it’s the belief that the future will be better, much better, than what has come before or even your current situation. This trick of the brain can effect how you remember the past and how you predict and plan for the future.
In this episode, Dr. Tali Sharot discusses her groundbreaking work and the impacts it can have on all areas of your life, from relationships to career decisions. If you want to understand the mysteries of your brain this is a conversation not to be missed.

      <title>Moment 91 - The "Harmless" Thing You Do That Hurts So Many People! - Richard Osmond</title>
      <description>Imagine being different and self conscious of this difference, then think of how it would feel to be reminded of this every single day of your life. In this moment Richard Osman discusses how he has been body shamed for over 30 years of his life. Ever since the impressionable age of 17 Richard has been made to feel small for his above average height. This changed his behaviour and meant that he held himself back from living the life he wanted to lead. Being ‘different’ has taught Richard about human nature and the hate in the world, but also empathy and what it means to put yourself in someone else’s shoes.

      <title>Davina McCall: “I was doing cocaine with my mum at 15!”</title>
      <description>Davina McCall has been an icon of television for 40 years. The host of Big Brother for over a decade, tens of millions of people looked to Davina to bring a national obsession into their homes. But few know the real story of Davina.
From a heartbreaking childhood that saw her take drugs with her mother to hosting one of the biggest shows in the world, she’s come a long way. At every step along her journey, no one was going to define her but herself. No matter how many times she got hurt no one could take away the one thing she could control, her resilience. Consistently breaking down barriers and forging new paths, Davina was the first female television host to put her bubbly and occasionally feisty persona front and centre, and she was the first mainstream figure to create a fitness platform that has inspired millions of people to get active in the fifteen years she’s been in the game.
Having consistently inspired so many people in her life, she dropped by to gift us some of her inspiration too.

      <title>Moment 90 - The Incredible &amp; Unexpected Power Of Vulnerability: Matthew Hussey</title>
      <description>What is real vulnerability? So often when we say that we are being vulnerable we are still giving a version of ourselves that we want and choose to show to the world. In this moment Matthey Hussey discuses the difference between a curated social media style vulnerability where you still have control, and genuine vulnerability. To be truly vulnerable means taking the risk of opening up to the world a part of yourself that you never wanted anyone to see and you cannot know if people will like. But Matthew says the reward for taking this step is huge, as it represents the start to deeper and richer relationships.

      <title>Neil deGrasse Tyson: DO THIS Every Morning To Find Happiness &amp; Meaning In Your Life</title>
      <description>For a lot of people black holes and string theory were topics that were filed in the mental box labelled ‘things I will never be able to get my head around”. However, all changed when Neil deGrasse Tyson began appearing on TV screens.
Neil’s passion and energy for science is infectious and the reason why he is one of the world’s greatest science communicators. This fascination has lasted ever since childhood where he felt the universe reach out to him at the same planetarium he is now the director of. But while Neil was obsessed with the cosmos he was often brought back to earth, having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotyping as he followed his passion.
In this conversation Neil discusses his quest in raising the global knowledge of space, the universe and the world’s beyond our own.

      <title>Barbara Corcoran: Turning $1,000 to $1 Billion!</title>
      <description>As the original Shark of all 13 seasons of the Shark Tank, Barbara Corcoran has never stopped swimming or hustling. Ever since 1973 when she borrowed $1000 to start her own real estate firm, Barbara’s relentless drive and spirit turned The Corcoran Group into $6 billion dollar business.
Coming from a poor neighbourhood and the second of ten children, Barbara always knew how to scrap and stand out from the crowd. She also knew how to use any setbacks as fuel for success, whether that was being labelled the ‘dumb’ D grade dyslexic student to being bitterly betrayed by her boyfriend.
In this candid conversation, Barbara shares her hard won no nonsense lessons in life and business, revealing how she had no other option but to become an entrepreneur and use everything at her disposal to reach the top.

      <title>Richard Branson: How A Dyslexic Drop-out Built A Billion Dollar Empire</title>
      <description>Told at school that he would either be successful or in prison, with a value of over $3 BILLION and earth’s atmosphere the only thing trapping him (for now), it’s an understatement to say that Sir Richard Branson became a success.
But behind the Virgin empire and its global offshoots, lies a dyslexic school leaver who never saw himself as intelligent, let alone a business person, who threw caution and conventional wisdom to the wind, transforming from business Virgin to visionary.
In this invaluable conversation, Richard shares the riches of his hard won lessons and the wisdom that can only come from an exceptional life. For all fans of The Diary Of A CEO podcast, this is truly a life changing conversation.

      <title>(EXCLUSIVE) Billy McFarland: The Man Behind The Infamous Fyre Festival Disaster</title>
      <description>The co-creator of the infamous Fyre festival, Billy McFarland spent 4 years behind bars for lying to investors and using the mythical tropical island festival as a way to pay off his debts. You have probably heard of him from the 2 massively popular documentaries that blew up on social media.
However, what you haven’t heard is the story of Billy as a childhood entrepreneur, creating and selling companies before he was even able to cash the cheques in his own bank account. A college dropout who moved to New York at 18 with nothing but hustle and drive.
Only months released from prison, Billy brings his still raw experiences to this intimate conversation, discussing everything from the motivation for the festival, his spectacular fall from grace and how he plans to pay back his debts and build back from nothing.

      <title>Stephen Fry: “Lost, alone and I wanted to take my life”</title>
      <description>To call Stephen Fry a national treasure would be underselling him. One of the hardest working names in British media, you name it and Stephen has done it; writer, actor, director and comedian. The size of his contribution to British culture in over four decades as a public figure is staggering.
However, behind this mountain of work and out of the spotlight is a side of Stephen Fry that many people will be completely unaware of, from a childhood of crime and loneliness, to severe mental health struggles and attempts at suicide.
In this honest and revealing conversation Stephen discusses the scars he carries within him and which affect him to this day. But despite this he is constantly reinventing himself and striving to find joy in the smaller things in life, all the while spreading happiness and wonder with his work.

      <itunes:summary>To call Stephen Fry a national treasure would be underselling him. One of the hardest working names in British media, you name it and Stephen has done it; writer, actor, director and comedian. The size of his contribution to British culture in over four decades as a public figure is staggering.
However, behind this mountain of work and out of the spotlight is a side of Stephen Fry that many people will be completely unaware of, from a childhood of crime and loneliness, to severe mental health struggles and attempts at suicide.
In this honest and revealing conversation Stephen discusses the scars he carries within him and which affect him to this day. But despite this he is constantly reinventing himself and striving to find joy in the smaller things in life, all the while spreading happiness and wonder with his work.

      <title>E200: Annie Macmanus: The Real Reason I Became Europe's No. 1 Female DJ </title>
      <description>Annie Macmanus is a voice we’ve been hearing for twenty years. First as a presenter and tastemaker for the UK’s biggest dance music radio show, as a festival headlining DJ, as host of her podcast ‘Changes with Annie Macmanus’, and now as an author of her best-selling novel ‘Mother Mother’. Reaching the pinnacle of success with a relentless schedule headlining a 2am show in Ibiza every week before flying back in the morning to present her daily radio show, it took the pandemic lockdowns for Annie to realise she wanted something completely different from her life. So she started again. This conversation explores her decision to check in with herself and walk away from a 17 year career at the BBC to explore her passions of writing and podcasts. She presents the challenging notion that your life needs to have a revolution every 20 years for it to remain meaningful and fulfilling. Topics: Early context People please Your parents Your insecurities Leaving Ireland - being rejected why didn't you keep trying? Labels Cost of being wrapped up in your labels Learning to listen to instinct Feeling burdened Midlife crisis doubts and fears making big decisions Why did you make it?

      <title>Charlie Sloth: From Homeless, To Fire In The Booth, To An £800 Million Business!</title>
      <description>Charlie Sloth is a radio presenter on Apple Music One, and previously on Radio One. The creator of “Fire in the Booth”, he is known as a adept and visionary patron of new artists worldwide. Appearing on Sloth's show is the moment many rappers and musical artists ‘make it’. Charlie wouldn’t have it any other way.
As he reveals in this episode, he has never deviated from his dream of bringing new talent to the fore. Even when he was living in a shed as a single father with a young son, he knew where he wanted to end up. That perseverance got him through the difficult moments, when nothing else would.
In this conversation Charlie opens up about the need to hold yourself to high standards, because the only feedback that’s actually going to take you to the next level is the feedback you give yourself. In a raw, honest and Frank exchange, Charlie shares his lessons that he’s picked up from a lifetime of hustling, from being a street artist to founding one of the worlds most successful vodka brands - Charlie is never someone to do things by halves.

      <title>Moment 85 - How To Speak So EVERYONE Listens To You: Julian Treasure</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment Julian Treasure opens up his vocal toolbox and talks about the importance of paying attention to your voice. While people focus on the content of their speeches and talks, their voice is just as important for every aspect of their life, considering that it is used to inspired, lead, communicate and build relationships. Julian believes that the voice should be treated as a skill rather than a natural capability, something that can be trained, improved and in turn have positive knock on effects for your happiness, health and wealth.

      <title>Louis Theroux: "The Thing That Makes Me Great At Work, Makes Me Bad At Life!" </title>
      <description>From his recent global TikTok fame to his BAFTA award-winning documentaries Louis Theroux has delighted audiences and grown a cult following with his distinctive brand of personality. Best know for his documentary series ‘Weird Weekends’, and ‘When Louis Met……’ Louis has explored the most controversial subjects with wide eyed curiosity and openness.
In this conversation Louis discusses how his childhood and upbringing affected his career, channeling his anxiety and social awkwardness into his work of exploring the darker aspects of human psychology and behaviour. He also talks about how his work has evolved and grown, from his initial big break in America to his new series of celebrity interviews, and how he has had to balance this with his family life. Just like with his documentaries, in this episode Louis brings his trademark honesty and openness.

Just like with his documentaries, in this episode Louis brings his trademark honesty and openness.</p><p><br></p><p>Louis:</p><p>Instagram - <a href="bit.ly/3AIepJg">bit.ly/3AIepJg</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWpVWUFZMHhHaTVCc2ZiVEZ0OHBhRVpvQVZSQXxBQ3Jtc0tsS3Uwb0xJSTZ4XzBoS1Q1cHdmSnpGcTVXSTAybHNvcVN0TzF6OEh6djBsYWlvaFFGdE5KYUstXzFHNUQ1YzFyeld6TDBhSmZqU1VuOURfNUZHdkd1bUd2TzNTanZ1VFVQckpOY3RuNkkxM1lJVU85VQ&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3EXtCsF&amp;v=cj8ojSVgU9I">http://bit.ly/3EXtCsF</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Labrinth: The Musical Genius Behind Euphoria</title>
      <description>Labrinth is a singer, rapper, producer, and composer behind HBO’s Euphoria. Achieving success at a young age, he gave it all up to go to America and start from the bottom all over again.
This is his story.
A true independent spirit, after getting frustrated with the corporate demands of Simon Cowell’s record label, he gave up his life in the UK where he had number one albums and an A list life to move to LA, where he was totally unknown.

      <title>Moment 84 - VP Of META Explains How To Get Exactly What You Want: Nicola Mendelsohn</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Nicola Mendelsohn CBE talks about the need to bring your whole self to work. Allowing the space and culture within companies for people to be who they are and know what matters to them leads people to becoming higher performers. She discusses the importance of understanding your core skills and strengths and having an informal ‘board of advisers’ to help you create a stronger vision of yourself. But, while it is crucial to ask for what you want, Nicola believes that it is just as important to do your homework on your career and know what truly matters to you, as no one else is going to do it for you.

      <title>Peter Crouch Opens Up About His Dark Times &amp; Crying Himself To Sleep</title>
      <description>Peter Crouch is a legend both on and off the football pitch. Capped 42 times for England, he is one of the few players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals. Since retirement he has further cemented his role as a cheeky national treasure with his role as a football pundit and host of That Peter Crouch Podcast.
But few up to now have seen the man behind the persona. It was childhood bullying and taunts about his height that helped to shape the down to earth man that audiences love today. Using this abuse as his fuel and motivation, he made sure that he let his actions on the pitch do the talking to prove his critics wrong.
This conversation explores his path and drive to footballing greatness, as well as his acknowledgement of the characteristics that led a select few of his teammates from great to legendary. He is a walking example of the benefits and rewards of staying true to yourself, keeping self-perspective and self-awareness, and the benefits of trying to be a good role model.

      <title>Bumble Founder: World’s Youngest Female Self-Made Billionaire: Whitney Wolfe Herd</title>
      <description>Whitney Wolfe Herd is the founder of Bumble and the first self-made female billionaire on the planet. In this episode, she reveals after leaving Tinder in explosive circumstances, the injustices she faced drove her on to build a better kind of dating app.
A firm believer that the way to connect with people is by being authentic and being vulnerable, Whitney reveals she routinely shares with her staff her struggles with anxiety and when she’s not feeling on top of things. The only path to human connection lies through honesty, and Whitney breaks the mould to be as transparent with her employees as she can.
In one of our rawest and most emotional conversations with CEOs yet, Whitney reveals that she wanted to be the boss not because she wanted to, but because she thought the nature of her character meant she couldn’t work for anybody else.

      <title>Moment 83 - Jay Shetty's 4 Pillars for Long Lasting Relationships </title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jay Shetty gives his 4 key pillars for long lasting relationships. Jay found these pillars after he says that one of the biggest mistake he has made, and humanity still makes, is chasing what he calls “divinity in humanity”. But the search for a non-existent perfect person with all the answers can lead to insecurity and anxiety. Instead, Jay talks about how every single person in your life should provide at least one of these key pillars and the importance of having them in your life.

      <description>Raphael Rowe is the host of Worlds Toughest Prisons on Netflix, the worldwide-hit show that takes us inside the toughest penitentiaries on the planet. It’s a world he knows well, wrongfully convicted of murder, he spent twelve years in maximum security prisons before he proved his innocence and was released.
In a conversation that goes into more depth about how he survived twelve years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit than he ever has before, Raphael bares all about the son he’s never spoken to, how he kept going against all the odds, what the experience taught him about life, and about himself.
But what’s striking about Raphael’s story is it’s often the simple things that get us through the difficult moments. A good relationship, exercise, self awareness. Raphael really illustrates how control over basic components of self and social awareness help people survive in even the toughest environments.

      <title>Gabor Mate: The Childhood Lie That’s Ruining All Of Our Lives</title>
      <description>Gabor Mate is a multi-bestselling author and a world leading expert on trauma and how it effects us throughout our whole lives. A holocaust survivor and a first generation immigrant, Gabor’s knowledge and wisdom on the scars trauma leaves behind is deep and drawn from personal experience.
In a conversation that unlocks the answers to people’s most burning questions about trauma, mental health, ADHD, and the hidden hardwire of our brain, Gabor brings us one step closer to really knowing ourselves and our inner urges. Gabor’s voice, both literally and in terms of what he has to say, is like a balm for anyone who’s mental health has ever caused them worries. Gabor has been through things few of us can ever imagine, and his insights are those few of us could ever have thought of before.

      <title>Moment 82 - Michael Jordan &amp; Kobe Bryant ALWAYS Won Because Of This: Tim Grover</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Tim Glover talks about the tiny differences that make the difference between winning and losing. There’s one thing that seperates the very best from the rest, and it is sweating every single tiny detail. Tim Glover is the man who was in charge of performance for both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. He sums up Kobe Bryant’s attitude to winning the NBA with one phrase: ‘Kobe Bryant was not interested in winning championships, he was obsessed’. For the top 1%, there is no such thing as letting it slide.

      <title>Dame Dash: The Man That DISCOVERED &amp; Built Jay-z &amp; Kanye West! </title>
      <description>Dame Dash is the co-founder of Roc-A-Fella records and the producer who discovered Jay-Z and Kanye West. A legend of hip hop and rap who changed not only the dominant sound within the genre, he totally upended the way it operated as a business. In this conversation, he tells his story. Always knowing that he could never work for anyone else, nor could he sell out his business to ‘corporates’, his has been the life of a true ‘independent’, going from one start up venture to the next with only one thing seemingly connecting his wildly diverse businesses: it was what he wanted to do.
In a raw and frank conversation Damon reveals the lessons he’s learnt from his triumphs and successes, his regrets, his proudest achievements, and the philosophy he’s developed and honed from them all.

      <title>Gabby Logan Opens Up About Her Heartbreaking Past </title>
      <description>Gabby Logan has been on our screens now for thirty years, bringing us the best of the world of sport at Sky Sports, ITV, and for the last nearly 20 years, at the BBC. Whether it’s the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby World Cup or the Olympics, Gabby is part of our memories of these moments. But there’s a side to Gabby people don’t often see. After her brother suddenly died when she was a teenager, she became (in her words) ‘fearless’ in pursuit of what she wanted, knowing that nothing would ever hurt as much again. But she was also wary of loving other people again, knowing what it was like to have those you love most taken away. It took her a long time and lot of introspection and learning to get to a place where she could open herself up emotionally to other people. But it’s when we look deep inside ourselves that it’s revealed who we really are, and what we really value.

      <title> Moment 81 - Malcolm Gladwell: What You Thought About Happiness and Fulfilment is Wrong</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Reflecting on why immigrants and children of immigrants are often more successful than average, Malcolm turns conventional thinking on its head by saying it’s because immigrants make a ‘b line’ for where they need to go. They do this by often asking themselves one question. A question that Malcolm reveals, and explains why it’s crucial. It’s from the big decisions we take, and the big questions we ask ourselves, that our greatest happiness derives from. We’ll let Malcolm explain it from here… Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/rN33bySDtub Malcolm: https://www.gladwellbooks.com https://twitter.com/Gladwell?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Wait list for The Diary - Add your name here: bit.ly/3fUcF8q Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <itunes:summary>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Reflecting on why immigrants and children of immigrants are often more successful than average, Malcolm turns conventional thinking on its head by saying it’s because immigrants make a ‘b line’ for where they need to go. They do this by often asking themselves one question. A question that Malcolm reveals, and explains why it’s crucial. It’s from the big decisions we take, and the big questions we ask ourselves, that our greatest happiness derives from.

      <title>Whoop Founder: How I Built A $3.6 BILLION Company &amp; BEAT Apple! Will Ahmed</title>
      <description>Will Ahmed is the founder of Whoop, the fitness monitoring app worn by LeBron James and Serena Williams, and which goes toe to toe with Apple, Google and Amazon.
Will is the classic example that business and entrepreneurial drive follow on from being obsessed with a problem.  After repeatedly getting injured in his college sports career, Will became obsessed with understanding his own body. He read over five hundred medical papers and realised the product he was pining for didn’t exist, so he invented it.
Will has one of the most original perspectives on how to bring your personality to your business that we’ve ever seen. Employees at Whoop get a bonus if their sleep is good, and the company is ruthless in its priorities to make sure it’s only focused on a couple of things at a time. All of this means Whoop has some of the best wearable tech on the market, despite only a fraction of the resources of its competitors.

      <title>Moment 80 - Bear Grylls: The Trick I Use To Find Confidence</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Bear Grylls tells us how to find lasting confidence. It’s incredible to think that someone like Bear - who’s a veteran of the SAS and conquered every challenge nature has had throw at him - struggles with Imposter Syndrome, but in this clip he reveals his journey to find confidence. Real confidence, according to Bear, comes from accepting that life will humble you, that life is often a battle, that sometimes you’ll lose as well as win. Only then can you appreciate the importance of doing your best, or DYB as Bear calls it. Because really going for things that we want without fear is, in the end, all we can do.

      <title>E186: Christian Horner: The Truth Behind Red Bull Racing's Success! | E186</title>
      <description>Christian Horner is the team principal of Red Bull Formula 1 racing team, which now officially holds the world title in drivers and constructors championships. An iconoclast and a one-off, he was the youngest team principal of a F1 racing team when he took over, nearly 20 years ago. He’s still the youngest team principal today. But his path to the top of the podium was not an easy one. Initially turning to team management in a desperate bid to stay in the sport when his driving career was flagging, for a while he was the sole driver, the lead engineer, the marketing and managing director of a veritable racing one man band. Now running an organisation of over 1200 people, Christian is one of the biggest characters on Formula One: Drive to Survive, the Netflix smash hit that has brought an entire new generation of fans into the sport, and the first generation to see for the first time the stresses and stakes of running a team that pushes people and machines to the edge of what’s possible, every single week. Topics: What drives you? Visualisation Why its important to focus on the details Ego Do you self analysis? The journey of turning red bull around communication within a company How did red bull innovate? Keeping teams focused? Why do you think your team will win? How hard should we push people?

      <itunes:summary>Christian Horner is the team principal of Red Bull Formula 1 racing team, which now officially holds the world title in drivers and constructors championships. An iconoclast and a one-off, he was the youngest team principal of a F1 racing team when he took over, nearly 20 years ago. He’s still the youngest team principal today. But his path to the top of the podium was not an easy one. Initially turning to team management in a desperate bid to stay in the sport when his driving career was flagging, for a while he was the sole driver, the lead engineer, the marketing and managing director of a veritable racing one man band. Now running an organisation of over 1200 people, Christian is one of the biggest characters on Formula One: Drive to Survive, the Netflix smash hit that has brought an entire new generation of fans into the sport, and the first generation to see for the first time the stresses and stakes of running a team that pushes people and machines to the edge of what’s possible, every single week. Topics: What drives you? Visualisation Why its important to focus on the details Ego Do you self analysis?

      <title>E185: David Harewood: The Chilling Story Of How A Hollywood Star Lost His Mind</title>
      <description>David Harewood is an award-winning actor, star of Supergirl and Homeland, and best-selling author behind Maybe I Don’t Belong Here, one of the best-reviewed and best-selling books of 2021. One of the best actors of his generation, with honours from Queen Elizabeth to prove it, David’s road to the top had to overcome his psychosis, which at one point drove him to the point of insanity and left him sectioned into a psychiatric hospital. With his life as he knew it on the brink, David rebuilt his life and career to reach the very top of the entertainment business. Scars like this take time to mend, and sometimes leave unexpected traces. David is controversially honest that losing his mind, in a way, helped him find his creativity. This isn’t the message that everyone wants to hear, but David’s frankness about how his darkest times set him apart from everyone else is a story you don’t want to miss. Topics: Early years Racism Your fathers illness Social rejection from everyone What would you have had to change inorder to not be sectioned? The night you got sectioned Being sectioned: Biology vs experiences The time being being sectioned and back to acting Opening up about your breakdown Where are you now? Why you?

      <title>E183: How I Became The Worlds Best DJ With Only One Arm: Black Coffee</title>
      <description>Black Coffee is one of the biggest DJs in the world, and one of the largest musical artists to ever come out of Africa full stop. Charging up to $300,000 a set, he’s one of the most coveted and in-demand DJs in the game today. But what people may not know about him is that he’s climbed to the top of the DJ world while being able to spin with only one arm, losing his ability to use the other in a tragic childhood accident. From the greatest adversity comes the greatest achievement, though, and Black Coffee took it as more inspiration to drive towards his dreams - relentlessly, unrelentingly, fearlessly. Black Coffee’s story is truly inspiring. He is just one of many we’re bringing to you this Black History Month, during which we’re making a special effort to bring you essential conversations with people of colour who are thought and industry leaders in their fields.  Topics:   Early years  Are you good with emotion  What role did music play in your household  The most pivotal day of your life   Did the accident make you work harder   Where you were going to be in 2 years   Why you over anyone else   Trouble with record labels telling you how to sound   How many show have you done this year   Therapy   The difference between you (Nathi) &amp; black coffee   What is your happiness   The last guest question   Black Coffee: https://www.instagram.com/realblackcoffee/ https://twitter.com/realblackcoffee  Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb  Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb   Sponsors Intel - https://g2ul0.app.link/Yh8T9b2KNtb Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb BlueJeans - https://g2ul0.app.link/NCgpGjVNKsb

      <title>E181: Maisie Williams: The Painful Past Of A Game Of Thrones Star</title>
      <description>Maisie Williams is one of the biggest actors in the world today. One of the breakout stars of Game of Thrones, Maisie hasn’t known a normal life since she was 11 years old when she was cast in the biggest tv show in the world. In this pathfinding and boundary-breaking conversation, Maisie reveals for the first time just how hard her start in life was. Even close to home, she had to overcome those who didn’t believe in her, and has had to battle through mental health issues ever since. Few journeys we’ve seen of people being able to define and find meaning in their own life despite those who doubt them are as inspiring as the one we’ve seen with Maisie. We are so proud of Maisie for bringing courage and honesty to the table today. It’s nothing less than the norm for her, because she’s shown courage and honesty all her life. Maisie: https://www.instagram.com/maisie_williams/ https://twitter.com/Maisie_Williams Maisie recommends this website if you need to talk to someone, it has got her through some of her worst days: https://www.7cups.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb Sponsors: Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb Craftd - https://g2ul0.app.link/gZ8in6Dsvsb

      <title>Moment 76 - The Number One Cause Of Anxiety Today: Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Tom Bilyeu walks us through how his struggles with anxiety have actually brought him to a place where he enjoys life to the fullest. He walks us through how he breaks his 'rehearsal of failure' and the worries that plague his head through meditation. Sometimes it takes issues in our life for us to see our position in most perspective. For Tom, his mental health battles are what made him sort out his diet, and get into a clear space in his own mind about what mattered to him. And when you have clarity, you can take action. When you take action, things change for the better. Listen to the full episode here -https://g2ul0.app.link/8alYCXxbxtb Tom: https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu/?hl=en https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E180: The Speaking Expert: How To Speak So Everyone Hears You: Julian Treasure</title>
      <description>Julian Treasure is a prolific author who is the world-leading expert on how to make yourself heard and be an engaged and empathetic listener. One of the most popular Ted speakers of all time, his talk ‘How to Speak So People Want to Listen’ has been viewed over 50 million times. When Julian speaks, people listen. And what we learned from Julian is that listening and speaking isn’t a simple case of give and take, one person speaking and another one listening. Instead, it’s a circle, the way one person talks effect the way the other person listens, and vice versa. We also learn the ‘leeches’, or common mistakes, that hold people back from effective and clear communicating. Do you think you’re a good listener and speaker? If you sub-consciously answered yes, there might be a crucial skill that you’re missing… Julian: https://twitter.com/juliantreasure?lang=en https://www.instagram.com/juliantreasure/?hl=en Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb  Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb  Sponsors: Vodafone for business - https://bit.ly/3f9Iqdh Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb

      <description>Mel C is a singer and ‘Sporty Spice’ from the Spice Girls, through her solo career and her time with the Spice Girls she’s sold over 100 million records, making her one of the best selling musical artists of all time. Every single one of those records was against the odds of coming from a council estate near Liverpool, derogatory labels in the press calling her ‘Sumo Spice’, and music industry management that didn’t believe in her and sought to objectify her. But she persevered and helped to build the biggest girlband of all time, as well as one of the most successful solo careers of any group member ever. The world is so glad she did because, as this conversation shows, she has so much to contribute when she’s let free to do things her way.

Topics: Early years Dancing Not being taken care of a a child Discovering singing &amp; joining the spice girls receiving horrible comments The come up of the spice girls The pressure being in a girlband Turning into a robot Depression Life after the spice girls Coming back together as the spice girls Wheres your line in sharing stuff The impact of your parents relationship on you The last guests question Mel: https://www.twitter.com/melaniecmusic https://www.instagram.com/melaniecmusic/ Mels book: https://amzn.to/3R1ikGl Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb Sponsors: Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb Craftd - https://g2ul0.app.link/gZ8in6Dsvsb </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 75 - What You Think You Know About Money Is Wrong: Mo Gowdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment Mo Gawdat lays out a philosophy for how to admit when you’re wrong, and the right way to go about setting priorities in your life. As Mo powerfully says, ‘50% of what I know is wrong’, and this is true for everyone. Coming to life from this position of humbleness is the only way we can truly get our head straight on what our life is and where it’s taking us. There are things that you need, like food and human interaction, and there are things that you want, like status or expensive possessions. Interrogating the insecurity in our wants and why we really want them is the best way to be at peace with ourselves, and to cut out toxic habits from our life. Because as Mo never tires of pointing out, it’s not how much money we have, but what amount of money we’re happy with, that counts. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/4GuqQfBYltb Mo: https://www.solveforhappy.com https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?hl=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E178: Lewis Capaldi: The Untold Story Of Becoming A Global Superstar At 22 </title>
      <description>Lewis Capaldi is one of the biggest singers and musicians in the world today whose last album went 4x platinum. His new single is Forget me and it’s out now. Known for his authentic and honest style, Lewis is unlike any poster that’s come before him. But behind the everyman ‘boy from Glasgow’ persona is a vulnerable side to Lewis. After a 3 year hiatus from music he tells us, for the very first time, he opens up about his struggles with sometimes crippling anxiety, how he ‘hates recording albums’, and the intense pressure he puts himself under that drives everything he does. This conversation is a hell of a ride. Expect what you thought you knew about Lewis to be turned upside down. But in the process of listening to this conversation with the pop star whose persona is that he has nothing to hide, you’ll see just how much he’s been holding back all this time. Topics: Early years Hypochondria Panic attacks Being self deprecating Comparing the first album to the new one The pandemic saved my panic attacks Questioning what I’m doing Tourettes Mental health What would you liked to have been at 16? How do others get where you are Social media marketing Writing songs Relationships Whats the questions you’e never been asked before? The downside of your passion becoming your profession Other people perception of you Are you confident Your new music Future goals The last guest question Lewis: https://www.instagram.com/lewiscapaldi/ Lewis’ new album: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4GNC7GD6oZMSxPGyXy4MNB?autoplay=true Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos) Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo](https://t.me/diaryofaceo) Sponsors: BlueJeans - https://g2ul0.app.link/NCgpGjVNKsb Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb

      <title>E177: Chris Kamara: The Untold Heartbreaking Story Of A Football Legend</title>
      <description>Chris Kamara is a former professional footballer and pundit who lit up our screens as part of Sky Sports punditry team for 25 years before he left Sky this year. He now has a podcast, Kammy and Ben’s Proper Football podcast. But there’s more to Chris than meets the eye. Behind the cheery facade is someone who’s had to overcome an incredibly hard start in life, from being one of the few black kids in his area to his family at times having to resort to beg for food. After a diagnosis with Apraxia, he is one of the most high-profile people with the disease. Chris has always managed to look for the positives in life no matter what it throws at him. A self-described ‘people person’, despite going through experiences most of us can only imagine he’s always found his glass half full. And if he can, any of us can. Chris: Twitter - https://bit.ly/3eGUuT3 Instagram - https://bit.ly/3xiaTUl Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/3kxINCANKsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E5re0ADNKsb Sponsors: Craftd - https://g2ul0.app.link/gZ8in6Dsvsb Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb

      <title>Moment 74 - Business Struggles That No One Tells You: Payal Kadakia</title>
      <description>In this moment, Classpass founder Payal Kadakia takes us inside the mental dilemmas and burdens of running a billion dollar business. Because when you’ve built a global company from nothing, no matter how big it gets you always remember when it was small, vulnerable, and struggling. You’ll always see the tiny company it used to be, not the behemoth it’s become. Payal freely admits to paying a heavy price of being too wary of this fear. She missed birthdays, lost friends, and severely effected her mental health. It took a lot of maturing and growing for Payal to achieve balance, balance between her work life and her home life, but also balance between what she wanted, and what she knew she needed.

Connection with other people, but also a better connection with yourself, what you really want, and what’s really good for you. These four incredible snippets from Mo Gawdat, Africa Brooke, Bear Grylls and Mel Robbins together offer inspiration on how to break through the mental barriers holding you back to feel more present in the moment and be clearer with yourself and others about your needs and desires. When a guest steps into the kitchen and sits themselves down, they’re not just appearing on a podcast, they’re joining the Diary of a CEO community. Every single conversation adds new dimensions of truth, honesty, wisdom and integrity. By bringing these four passages together, it shines new light on the individual value of them all, but it also helps us understand the journey we’re all on together in more perspective. Topics: Mo Gawdat - Retrain Your Brain Africa Brooke - How To Overcome A Sexless Relationship Bear Grylls - How To Build Resilience Mel Robins - What to do when you're feeling stuck Mo: https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/ https://twitter.com/mgawdat Africa: https://www.instagram.com/africabrooke/ https://africabrooke.com/ Bear: https://twitter.com/BearGrylls https://www.instagram.com/beargrylls/?hl=en Mel: https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/ https://twitter.com/melrobbins Sponsors: Craftd - https://g2ul0.app.link/gZ8in6Dsvsb Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb

      <title>Moment 73 - Simon Sinek: How To Find Ultimate Fulfilment At Work</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Simon Sinek talks about how we can find purpose in our lives through attaching it to causes bigger than ourselves. There are things that we can achieve by ourselves, but true satisfaction and real pride in our achievements always comes from being part of a team or a collective. A wider cause or a group we care about is the only thing that would cause us to make real sacrifices. Simon’s thought long and hard about how we can take projects in the workplace and in our social lives and infuse them with real meaning for everyone involved with them. What’s emerged is a profound meditation on where human satisfaction really comes from, and a step by step guide on how to bring these principles into your life. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/bjurcFnPYsb Simon: https://twitter.com/simonsinek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor https://www.instagram.com/simonsinek/?hl=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E174: James Smith: Become Confident In 100 Minutes</title>
      <description>James Smith is a fitness influencer and the two-time best-selling author of Not a Life Coach and Not a Diet Book. His no holds barred approach to fitness advice makes him unlike any other fitness influencer today, and now he’s bringing his unique philosophy to improving people’s confidence. According to James, we’ve been getting self confidence and how to achieve it all wrong. Confidence is not a surefire belief in ourselves to achieve great things, but rather confidence is being at peace with the idea of losing or things going wrong. When you know it isn’t the end of the world, you realise losing isn’t the same as being defeated. Like James’ brutally honest fitness advice, there’s no quick fix to confidence, or any miracle cure. James starts, like he always does, by looking at himself honestly - and truthfully - in the mirror, and all he asks is we do the same as well. James’ book is out today. Topics: Why did you write a book about confidence How deep are our confidence issues? Our pain points in confidence The base of confidence and how we build it what is audacity? A: Airing your opinions Happiness recipe Productivity Are you a workaholic Your relationships monogamy Dating How do I help my friend that isn't changing? What do you need to work on? Building confidence with evidence picking your passengers utility of deprivation concept what is your goal? The worst day of your life How can someone build confidence today? The opposite to happiness is boredom The last guests question James’ book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Be-Confident-international-bestselling/dp/0008536449 James: https://www.instagram.com/jamessmithpt/ https://mobile.twitter.com/jamessmithpt_ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/aTf9jh8Zvsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E561VVf0vsb Sponsors: Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/G4RjcdKNKsb BlueJeans - https://g2ul0.app.link/NCgpGjVNKsb

      <title>E173: Pret &amp; Itsu Founder: How I Built TWO Billion Dollar Brands At The Same Time!: Julian Metcalfe</title>
      <description>Julian Metcalfe is the founder of Pret A Manger and Itsu, and since he’s been a young man has been on a mission to change the way we think about eating out and how we eat. His companies are together worth over $3 billion. But he’s also been on a mission to prove something to himself after the suicide of his mother and a life threatening car crash when he was still young uprooted his life as he knew it. Like all founders, he chose the long road back to being secure in himself Julian spews with original thoughts on how to really take a company from zero to $1 billion+, from hiring and firing to knowing when to take the leap to expand your brand. Business is a game of thousands of little decisions, a few really big ones, and a hawks eye for knowing when to pounce. Few people we’ve encountered on the podcast had such a good gut instinct as Julian, nor were so good at articulating exactly how they did it. Topics: Early years The affect your parents had on you The importance of transparency Affection &amp; self esteem Was money driving you? what was the "specialness" that made Pret successful How I run my businesses Selling Pret Starting ITSU The hardest day of your career Finding out you had a daughter What are you scared of?

      <title>E172: Growing A 10+ Million Youtube Following At The Age of 22: Joe Sugg</title>
      <description>Joe Sugg is an influencer who, after breakout success before he turned 21, decided to dial down the parties and temptations of fame in order to return to nature and make everything more low key. After realising he didn’t enjoy his life as much as he was supposed to, some serious prioritisation about what his real values were and what really mattered to him was in order in order to refocus and rebalance his life.

      <title>E171: Making $100 Million A Year Eating Raw Liver: Liver King</title>
      <description>The Liver King is an illusive internet sensation who says the secret to a healthy and happy life is to eat raw meat every day. An advocate of what he calls an 'ancestral lifestyle', we have to return to the lifestyle our hunter-gatherer forebears. Returning to this way of living is most consistent with our DNA and what we're genetically coded to want according to the Liver King. A controversial figure, his advocating of this diet is disputed by many nutritionists, but the Liver King says it has transformed his life, that of his family, and his followers who take up his suggestion. In this raw interview the Liver King opens up on criticism and his sometimes crippling anxieties for the first time, as well as how his ancestral lifestyle shapes his bond with his wife, the Liver Queen. It isn't always easy to be the king. Topics: Early years Whats your dark side What made you become Liver King? Accountability The benefits of the 9 ancestral tenets The way you sleep Food - What are we doing wrong? Bonding and connection Are you optimistic in this digital world? Liver Kings brand Criticism The hardest moment of your adult life Depression &amp; Anxiety Your business portfolio What role does money play in your life Liver queen Monogamy as a primal What do you need to work on? What are you teaching your kids about emotion?

      <title>E170: Gary Neville: From Football Legend To Building A Business Empire</title>
      <description>Gary Neville is a broadcaster, serial business founder and owner, and a winner of every possible club football title in his 20 years playing for Manchester United - with 2 Champions League medals, 8 Premier League medals, 3 FA Cup medals, a Club World Cup medal, and 2 League cup medals. In one of his most emotional and heartfelt interviews to date, Gary opens up about precisely what drove him and his similarly successful siblings on - his brother is the England-capped footballer Philip Neville, while his sister is the former Head Coach of England Netball, Tracey Neville - despite their very humble origins. A legend of Manchester United and a former captain of the club, he goes into detail about precisely what made the team culture of the Sir Alex Ferguson years so strong, why its so sorely lacking now, why he’s felt the need to speak out more on social and political issues, and why everything he does is for the city he grew up in and calls home. Even after all these years, he’s still bringing glory back to Manchester. Topics: How did you and your family become so successful in sport? What the cost of your drive? You’re self disparaging about your skills Alex Ferguson’s mindset What you have you learnt from Sir Alex about culture? Why are Manchester United failing now? Your businesses Politics Mental health Your dad The next 10 years If happiness was a recipe The last guest question Gary's Twitter: https://g2ul0.app.link/At9sxqODAsb Gary's Instagram: https://g2ul0.app.link/G5IEbtQDAsb Gary’s book, available for pre-order now: https://g2ul0.app.link/3Y26i8G6ysb Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/Hlol7fTDAsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/xH53MFVDAsb Sponsors: Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wjmvak5nAsb BlueJeans - https://g2ul0.app.link/rB98ls8nAsb

      <description>Nicola Mendelsohn is Meta’s (formerly Facebook) global head of advertising and routinely tops lists “most powerful person in UK tech. She’s juggled her high flying career with having a rare type of blood cancer since 2016.

No one is ever going to get to define Nicola except her. In this candid chat about how she’s seen her role and her company change as it’s come under increasing criticism in the last few years, Nicola holds nothing back on her critics, her fears, her highs, her lows, and what she still wants herself and the company to achieve. Topics: What made you the person you are today? What did you learn from working in the marketing industry? Joining Facebook &amp; leading the EMEA market Your journey with cancer How did it impact your work &amp; life? Mark Zuckerberg &amp; company culture From Facebook to Meta &amp; what is the Metaverse The good and the bad of the digital world Mark Zuckerberg’s real personality Protecting young children online Personalised advertising and businesses Your core strengths and importance of being yourself Growth moments &amp; speaking up for what you want New book &amp; encouraging females to set up business Work-life balance Our last guest’s question Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://g2ul0.app.link/aTf9jh8Zvsb Follow us on Telegram: https://g2ul0.app.link/E561VVf0vsb Nicola's Twitter: https://g2ul0.app.link/t9DYxjBKqsb Nicola’s Instagram: https://g2ul0.app.link/xf4gYKzsvsb Sponsors: Crafted - https://g2ul0.app.link/gZ8in6Dsvsb Huel - https://g2ul0.app.link/wzHTPvHsvsb Vodafone Business - https://g2ul0.app.link/XagvMyKsvsb ‘reliable and critical connectivity’: https://www.vodafone.co.uk/network#faqs

      <title>Moment 70 - How Jonny Wilkinson Made It To The Top </title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week’s moment is all about passion. Where to find it, how to nurture it, and how not to be afraid of it. Far too many people are afraid of just following their instincts to what makes them happiest and most fulfilled. Jonny Wilkinson doesn’t have time for any of that, or for following the expectations other people set. Jonny is interested in what makes you unique, and he thinks you should be too. Jonny’s also got a word of warning, though, because your real self is who you are when you’re alone with your own thoughts. And Jonny’s weren’t happy. He scaled as high as it’s possible to go in world rugby, but he found the process demoralising, and he wasn’t happy. It took Jonny a long time to find a way to be happy in his passion, but that makes his journey all the more interesting, and his advice for your journey all the more profound too.

      <title>E168: Building A Business Empire WITHOUT ANY Marketing: Five Guys CEO: John Eckbert </title>
      <description>John Eckbert is the CEO of Five Guys in Europe. By far the most successful ‘posh burger’ chain in Britain, John tells us how he took a classic concept to a whole new content by inventing a unique business model. Five Guys in Europe is not just a franchise, but John rather started from zero on a joint venture which has so managed to eclipse the dozens of other similar businesses that launched at the same time, and then some. As well as dishing out profound business and management advice, John walks us through how a sea-change in his personal life left him feeling trapped and alone. But John fought fires at both home and work in order to make Five Guys what it is today. We’re so glad he did. Topics: What shaped your business mentality? Five Guy’s journey Building a successful business without marketing How to stop employees becoming compliant Installing company values Hiring the best people Attention to detail How do you keep calm? Hardest moments &amp; how to handle them Critical feedback, standards &amp; customer service Business decisions and their impact What’s the biggest threat to Five Guys? What makes you happy? Self-awareness What’s are the foundations of your future?

      <title>Moment 69 - People Pleasing Is Hurting You: Lewis Howes</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Lewis Howes lays down exactly why you need to stop being a people pleaser if you want lasting and deep relationships. What Lewis teaches us is that real relationships come from someone loving us for who we are, not from who we’re pretending to be. Any act or pretence we put on about ourselves will inevitably get found out. So you have to come as yourself, for better and for worse. How do you find an authentic way to express your true self? Let Lewis explain… Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/lPEJbP9Xdsb Lewis: https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/?hl=en https://twitter.com/LewisHowes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E166: James Bay: Imposter Syndrome, Trauma &amp; Controlling The Voice In Your Head</title>
      <description>James Bay is a BRIT-award winning musician who’s sold over 5 million records, and one of the most personal and authentic artists working in the field today. Never afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve in his work, his artistry has helped millions of people articulate feelings in their own heart of love, regret, and friendships made and ended. He’s definitely come a long way from the small town where he grew up, which he escaped through grasping every opportunity that came his way. There’s perhaps no industry tougher to succeed in than music, and this fear that there’s only a few that make it has haunted him at every step. So settle down and let James walk you through every step of what the creative process looks like at the elite level - where inside him it comes from, what inspires it, and how he delivers his music. James’ new album ‘Leap’ is out now. Topics: Childhood Idle time, insecurities &amp; expectations Becoming a musician and its learnings How did it change your life? Your albums and its influence Would you change anything? Your mental health The consequences and symptoms of your inner voice The cost of fame Your partner Your latest album  Our last guest’s question James: https://twitter.com/JamesBayMusic https://www.instagram.com/jamesbaymusic/ James’ new album: https://www.jamesbay.com Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven BlueJeans - https://www.bluejeans.com/

      <title>E165: The Marketing Secrets Apple &amp; Tesla Always Use: Rory Sutherland</title>
      <description>Rory Sutherland is the author of Alchemy, a senior advertising executive, and the man who understands why some ideas connect with people and some ideas don’t. He’s a columnist, an innovator and a trailblazer in the world of marketing and advertising.
Rory doesn’t have time for business platitudes, but rather looks for the unconventional crazy ideas that really stand out. This is why he devoted years of his life to looking at business from a human behavioural perspective, to understand not just why people should do things, but why they actually do them.
Rory always seeks out the outlier and the unexplainable phenomena. He’s become an expert on why certain emotional triggers cause us to behave irrationally, how you can be aware of yourself when you aren’t making smart decisions, and how you can deploy those triggers when you’re trying to sell something yourself. Rory blessed us with his one of a kind knowledge to make this one of the most memorable conversations we’ve had with an author for a while.

Topics:

The concept of how we value things

Recursive Trends

The brain's marketing function: Signalling

technology making location irrelevant

making something bad to give it value

Scarcity of product

personalisation

how to deliver a product to the world

Why business are focusing on the wrong thing

Personal branding

Why do you think you successful

The last guest question

      <itunes:summary>Rory Sutherland is the author of Alchemy, a senior advertising executive, and the man who understands why some ideas connect with people and some ideas don’t. He’s a columnist, an innovator and a trailblazer in the world of marketing and advertising.
Rory doesn’t have time for business platitudes, but rather looks for the unconventional crazy ideas that really stand out. This is why he devoted years of his life to looking at business from a human behavioural perspective, to understand not just why people should do things, but why they actually do them.
Rory always seeks out the outlier and the unexplainable phenomena. He’s become an expert on why certain emotional triggers cause us to behave irrationally, how you can be aware of yourself when you aren’t making smart decisions, and how you can deploy those triggers when you’re trying to sell something yourself. Rory blessed us with his one of a kind knowledge to make this one of the most memorable conversations we’ve had with an author for a while.

Topics:

The concept of how we value things

Recursive Trends

The brain's marketing function: Signalling

technology making location irrelevant

making something bad to give it value

Scarcity of product

personalisation

how to deliver a product to the world

Why business are focusing on the wrong thing

Personal branding

Why do you think you successful

The last guest question

      <title>Moment 68 - Do This If You Don’t Like Your Job: Marcus Buckingham</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Marcus Buckingham, is one of the world's most in-demand career experts and the author of several best-selling business books focusing on strengths versus weaknesses, how to take feedback, how to love your work and identify leadership. In this moment I talk to Marcus about how we are supposed to build a great career that we love. The three main question points we all ask ourselves when we are in a working role is the ‘who’, the ‘what’ and the ‘why’. The ‘why’ is so important to think about - why are you doing doing what you are currently doing, why do you believe in the purpose of what you are doing? The ‘who’ is also crucial. Working with people you like, being in a great team, and amongst inspiring people plays a powerful role in our work. But for Marcus, the ‘what’ trumps the ‘who and ‘why’. What are the activities and roles you are actually doing? What do you love about them?  Marcus has a theory about the different threads our days are made up of. These threads ultimately create the fabric of a work day; layers, structures, colours, textures, which can be interpreted into feelings, highs, lows, loves and loathes. The most successful people are able to identify what threads work well for them. In order for this to happen, we need an early framework and a sense of shared understanding about what we naturally lean into, our passions and skills. If we start early on the right threads from a younger age, we will be able to create a career that we love.

      <description>Krept is a rapper and one half of the the iconic rap duo Krept and Konan. The host of the Rap Game, Krept is a star of our tv screens as well as the recording studio. And with his multiple business successes, Krept has built empires from scratch in multiple areas of his life. It’s a world away from experiencing crime and poverty as a young boy. Krept has routinely looked into the darkest areas of his psyche to find the motivation to propel himself forwards, finding unexpected truths about the human condition in the process. Krept’s been stabbed, had to pull his business back from the suicide of his partner, and built his way out of Croydon. There’s so many times in his life where he’s had to bounce back after unimaginable setbacks. But he did it. In full context and with frank honesty, he tell us exactly how he did it. Topics: Early years Could you see how things could have gone a different way? Going on tour Mental mental health Nash - Krept and Konan Finding out about Nash How are you feeling? When was it when everything changed for you? Your relationship with money The Hiphop culture making people want to spend money Nala's baby What have you learnt from Nala’s baby Being attacked backstage Cadet’s death The last guests question Krept: https://www.instagram.com/kreptplaydirty/?hl=en Nala’s baby: https://nalasbaby.com/ Our new apparel line: https://thedoac.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: BlueJeans - https://www.bluejeans.com/ Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven

      <title>Moment 67 - The HIDDEN Power of REGRET: Daniel Pink</title>
      <description>In this Moment Daniel Pink opens up on how we can turn regret into our superpower. There is no emotion as forceful or driving to us as that niggling feeling when we didn't get it right. Rather than shut out or deny that emotion, Daniel takes us through step-by-step how we can turn the tables on our own regrets to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes again. Daniel brought such a positive attitude to this recording that our mistakes are opportunities for learning and a teachable moment, not burdens that have to dog us for the rest of our lives. Seeing the hidden power of regret is to realise everything is fixable, mendable and figure out-able.

      <title>E161: Coinbase Founder: The Crazy Journey Of Building A $100 Billion Company: Brian Armstrong</title>
      <description>Brian is the co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, a company thats reached highs of a valuation of $100 billion. After an adolescence and youth searching for independence where no one could be his boss, he’s come a long way, but he’s realised he’s had to change a lot too. Before anyone had heard of Bitcoin, there was Coinbase. Taking a punt on an industry no one knew and no one understood, Brian quit his lucrative career to be his own man. No one encouraged him. No one. He’d told the idea to hundreds of people before someone told him it could work. In this conversation, Brian brought a wisdom and a nuance about how to run and build a business like very few conversations we’ve had on this podcast. If you want to know how the best in the world take an idea from drawboard to $100 billion, this is the story of how it happened. Topics: What made you the person you are today Lessons learnt from my first business How traveling shaped me Working for AirB&amp;B and what made it successful The mistake a lot of entrepreneurs make How to build a sustainable company How to incentive your team to take risks My journey starting Coinbase Mistakes &amp; key learnings when starting up Leadership lessons Fake news and dealing with it No politics in the workplace Hiring the best people &amp; layoffs What are the ingredients in your happiness recipe Brian Armstrong: https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong Thirdweb: https://thirdweb.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: BlueJeans - https://www.bluejeans.com/ Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Crafted - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>E160: Victimhood &amp; Self-sabotage Is Destroying The World In 2022: Africa Brooke</title>
      <description>Africa Brooke is a speaker and podcast host, who has built a community that has helped hundreds of thousands of young people navigate the unique pressures of the world today. From binge drinking to cancel culture, sexual empowerment to race and politics - Africa isn’t afraid to speak completely honestly and frankly about anything. No one has come in to speak to us with as much honesty and vulnerability as Africa. This is a one-of-a-kind conversation that left us speechless. There's never a topic on Diary of a CEO that’s off-limits, we will always bring you the world’s leading people telling their honest truth. What to make of their opinions is up to you, but as soon as Africa walked through the door of my kitchen to record, any pre-conceptions of what she was about to say were left on the other side. She certainly didn’t hold anything back. Africa: Topics: Early years - my father What is your dark side? What was the cost? How to break out of a negative reinforcing cycle? What do you still self sabotage Left vs Right Accountability Selfawareness A journey with sex and sexuality What is the pain you enjoy having? What ideas do you hold to be true that everyone else disagrees with? The ingredient for happiness Last guest question Africa: https://www.instagram.com/africabrooke/ https://africabrooke.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: BlueJeans - https://www.bluejeans.com/ Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven

      <title>E159: Chris Eubank Jr. Opens Up About His Grief, Living In His Father’s Shadow &amp; His Future</title>
      <description>Chris Eubank Jr. is a boxer on his way to being the best in the world. A journey into boxing like no other, Chris didn’t just have to step out of the shadows of his own demons to make his name in the ring, but out of the shadow of his own father. But Chris’s journey to the top hasn’t been seamless. He’s been knocked back by some bruising defeats, and - as he explains - by tragedy. When his brother tragically died of a heart attack, Chris’s world almost fell apart. But it isn’t how you get knocked down, it’s how you get back up. Over and over again in Chris’s life, he’s had to look deep within himself to find his inner strength to match his outward toughness. It hasn’t been easy for him, but he wouldn’t have had it any other way. Topics: Where did your discipline &amp; strength come from? Why I never give up What made you different from everyone else? Are you emotional? Have you spoken to your dad about emotions? The death of your brother &amp; how it changed you Keeping relationships private Boxing and its health implications Anxiety &amp; online trolls What’s next for you Our last guest’s question Chris: https://twitter.com/chriseubankjr https://www.instagram.com/chriseubankjr/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: BlueJeans - https://www.bluejeans.com/ Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Crafted - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>Moment 65 - Jimmy Carr On Knowing You're Enough</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jimmy Carr walks us through how exactly to find out what it is that's going to bring you happiness, and how to find satisfaction in your life. He tells us exactly how to interpret your actions and interrogate your feelings to bring out your true desires. It took Jimmy a long time to find out what he really wanted from life, and he was nearly trapped by the expectations he and other people put on himself when he felt himself moving towards a corporate life he didnt want. Jimmy set himself free, and in this moment he explains how you can set yourself free too.

      <title>E158: Michael Pollan: How To Change Your Mind</title>
      <description>Michael Pollan is an author who between his five bestsellers has sold millions of books. Through exploring our connection to the natural world, he reveals sides of ourselves that we never knew we had. As an author and a journalist, it’s Michael’s job to question everything. But in his 50s he turned the tables on himself and began to question his own assumptions. What followed was a one-of-a-kind journey that took him to explore the nature of his own perception of the world which would take him into trying going caffeine-free and trying psychedelic drugs. Now, he shares what he’s learnt from that journey with us. Michael’s book, This is Your Mind on Plants, is out in paperback this summer, and his Netflix series How to Change Your Mind drops July 12th. Topics: Follow your passion Immersive journalism Trying to solve systemic problems with individual acts, BLM &amp; food system Caffeine and its impact on us Pollination &amp; drugs Psychedelics Are psychedelics the cure to mental health problems? When to do psychedelics How to freshen your mind &amp; get out of your comfort zone Our last guest’s question Michael: https://www.instagram.com/michael.pollan/ https://twitter.com/michaelpollan/ Michael’s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Your-Plants-Michael-Pollan/ Michael’s Netflix series: https://www.netflix.com/title/80229847 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven

      <title>E157: Brewdog Founder: The Untold Story Of One Britain’s Fastest Growing Companies: James Watt</title>
      <description>James Watt is the CEO and founder of Brewdog, the Scottish craft beer sensation that is now valued at $2 billion. A former sea captain, he’s had to navigate increasingly choppy waters at Brewdog. But after a string of allegations rocked the company, ranging from personal impropriety to financial misconduct to marketing scams, James has had to start from scratch in Brewdog’s reputation, and on his own management style. For the first time, James walks us through his mistakes, what he denies, and what he defends. Where does the line blur between a hard-driving start-up and a toxic culture. It’s a tricky balance many challenger companies have to contend with. James’ is a story where he sailed a little close to the wind, when the revelations dropped it looked like everything he built could slip away. Can he navigate Brewdog back to dry land? He tells us exclusively how he plans to. Topics: Your early years Being a sea captain &amp; what it taught you The start of Brewdog Your marketing principles Adjustments from being a fisherman to CEO of a global company Your leadership evolution Why don't you step down as CEO? Did you ever imagine you’d be here? Forgiving your mother for creating 'that voice? Punks with purpose letter Horrific interviewing techniques Why did you invest in Heineken? Autism Whats the silver lining here? Anxiety &amp; therapy The future of Brewdog - sustainability Finance advice The last guests question James: https://www.instagram.com/brewdogjames/?hl=en https://twitter.com/BrewDogJames?s=20&amp;t=wXnTEyTvBKbmeTrXwFFrcg Shows mentioned Good Ship BrewDog, BBC sounds - https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0cfkklv?partner=uk.co.bbc&amp;origin=share-mobile The Truth about BrewDog - https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0013yfj Books mentioned: Ben Horowitz - amazon.co.uk/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr= Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Vodafone Business - https://bit.ly/3NIM35n https://bit.ly/3AuPKsA

      <title>Moment 64 - What You Need To Know About Following Your Passion: Patricia Bright</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Patricia Bright lays out the benefits - and the potential pitfalls - of following your passion. We always have to stay authentically in touch with what we love to do, and why we love doing it. This moment lays out how people can lose their way in following their passion, and how to avoid it. It’s a rare gem who can persevere with their passion to the point where it’s not only their work, but work they love to do and feel themselves doing. We’re so glad she did, and we think you’ll be glad she did too.

      <title>E156: Tony Bellew: Nothing Made Me Happy Until I Found This</title>
      <description>Tony Bellew is a professional boxer and a former British, Commonwealth and World Champion. As well as this, he is also an actor, and the star of Creed with Sylvester Stallone, and the author of last year's bestselling book, Everybody Has A Plan Until They Get Punched in the Face. In this raw, honest and emotional interview, Tony breaks down exactly why people dedicate their life to fighting, and how it’s often because they have no other choice. But also because it comes to fill a need inside of them, and Tony opens up on what this inner need can do to you if you leave it unchecked. Many times, Tony has had to bring his life back from the brink - of poverty, bullying, defeats, and his own emotional instincts. His story is a fascinating example of how it’s often things we’re good at that cause us the most trouble, but when we face that honestly we can come through stronger the other side. Topics: What are the most pivotal moments of your childhood? Racism &amp; its impact on you Your relationship with your father &amp; his prison years Street life &amp; lack of role models The death of your first trainer &amp; his prediction of your success Becoming a world champion How much boxers actually make Chimp Paradox Dealing with grief &amp; depression How to deal with hard moments Our last guest's question Tony: https://www.instagram.com/tonybellew/?hl=en https://twitter.com/TonyBellew/ Tony’s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everybody-Plan-Until-They-Punched/dp/1841884707 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>E155: Bear Grylls: Man VS Failure, Anxiety &amp; Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>Bear Grylls is a British adventurer and television host who has been an international sensation of survival shows for twenty years. The host of Man vs. Wild, You vs. Wild, Running Wild, The Island, and the author of Mud, Sweat and Tears and over twenty other books, he’s come in to talk to us about his new book - Never Give Up. Bear has always told himself a story about himself that he’s ‘resilient’, he’s pushed through the toughest challenges the world has to offer - from climbing Everest to surviving in the desert - because he’s told himself he’s the type of person who survives. But now, he reflects to us about the costs of that mentality, and where it leaves you when you come up short. Bear’s new book is a follow-up to his smash-hit bestseller Mud, Sweat and Tears. He’s spent five years writing it, written every single word himself, and shares some lessons from his life he’s never felt comfortable sharing before. It was a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to speak to him in my kitchen. Topics: Confidence Imposter syndrome Resilience When to quit Are we always chasing a bigger challenge? Finding your faith Climbing Everest was humbling Struggling with fame Anxiety What were your darkest moments? What would you say to your father if he was alive?

      <itunes:summary>Bear Grylls is a British adventurer and television host who has been an international sensation of survival shows for twenty years. The host of Man vs. Wild, You vs. Wild, Running Wild, The Island, and the author of Mud, Sweat and Tears and over twenty other books, he’s come in to talk to us about his new book - Never Give Up. Bear has always told himself a story about himself that he’s ‘resilient’, he’s pushed through the toughest challenges the world has to offer - from climbing Everest to surviving in the desert - because he’s told himself he’s the type of person who survives. But now, he reflects to us about the costs of that mentality, and where it leaves you when you come up short. Bear’s new book is a follow-up to his smash-hit bestseller Mud, Sweat and Tears. He’s spent five years writing it, written every single word himself, and shares some lessons from his life he’s never felt comfortable sharing before. It was a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to speak to him in my kitchen. Topics: Confidence Imposter syndrome Resilience When to quit Are we always chasing a bigger challenge? Finding your faith Climbing Everest was humbling Struggling with fame Anxiety What were your darkest moments? What would you say to your father if he was alive?

      <title>Moment 63 - How To Get Any Task Done: Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Oliver Burkeman tells us about the power of positive, sustainable habits, or as he calls them - 'radical incrementalism'. It's possible that by making just a little change to our daily lives, a change we can really sustain and not just keep up for a few weeks, then the accumulative effects we see over a long period of time can be life-changing. By enabling just little changes in our actions the consequences compound into something truly extraordinary. Oliver's no-nonsense advice shows just how straightforward it can be to unlock transformative positive changes in your life. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/oMWiaQcd6qb

      <title>E153: How I Raised $700 Million: Charity: Water Founder</title>
      <description>Scott Harrison is the founder and CEO of Charity: Water, one of the most innovative non-profit organisations in the world. Bringing the Netflix model to the charity sector, Scott has built a positive community around trying to bring drinking water to the 700 million people who don’t have access to it. For this episode, we’ve partnered with Charity: Water to ensure that all of the proceeds we receive from it will go towards providing drinking water to the people who need it the most. The story of how Scott came to lead a global movement in water provision is unlike any other. A former nightclub promoter and owner, he was a user of every type of drug under the sun before he cleaned up his act and started again. Because when he asked himself what was most important, it wasn’t his own pleasure, but helping other people. Topics: Early Years Attention seeking &amp; becoming a nightclub promoter Being deprived of fun led me into drugs and alcohol abuse Death threads &amp; finding my purpose Leaving my life and vice behind Humanitarian work in Africa and its impact on me How did it feel helping people &amp; starting your own charity? Promoting clean water for the whole world What struggles did the charity face? Work-life balance The importance of giving and service Our last guest's question To help Scott in his mission, we are donating 100% of the advertising revenue from this episode to help people access clean water.

      <title>Moment 62 - Mens Mental Health Isn't Talked About Enough, Here’s Why: Roman Kemp</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. With it being Men’s Mental Health Awareness Month, I felt it was important in this week’s moment to focus on the importance of checking in with this prevalent topic in our current society. Roman Kemp tells us about the time he nearly lost his life, and how he was saved by a simple phone call from his mother checking up on him. Suffering from depression since he was a teenager, Roman has sometimes had trouble finding balance in his life. Thankfully, no one knew the ins and outs of his struggle like his mother. When she phoned him up asking how he was doing, he gave her an answer she was not expecting. She would never have imagined having to receive something like this from her son. Simple check ups with our friends and loved ones can have much more impact than we ever anticipate. Likewise, being open about our feelings can help to change them if they’ve gone down a bad path. I hope this moment from our conversation will help you to open up with your friends, and make this something normal to talk about.

      <description>Jane Wurwand is the co-founder of Dermalogica, which revolutionised skincare for millions of people worldwide. One of the first skincare brands when it launched in the 1980s, Jane got people to care about something they didn’t realise was important. Today she finally tells her incredible story in this conversation and in her new book, Skin in the Game. Jane’s story to self-independence begins when she was in a toxic relationship with a controlling boyfriend, in a strange country she knew little about. She describes feeling the physical hand of her late father on her shoulder guiding her where to go next. She picked herself up, and with a new partner used her new business as a fresh chapter in her life. Then, her industry was just one clinic in Los Angeles. Now, it’s a chain worth billions. Jane lit the touchpaper on a revolution, and in finding her own confidence, Jane helped millions of others find theirs too. How did you become the person you're today How did moving to South Africa impact you? Starting up as an entrepreneur and moving to LA What made you a good entrepreneur?

      <title>Moment 61 - How To Handle ANY Rejection: Dr. Julie Smith</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment episode, Dr. Julie Smith offers a different way of trying to get to know your own instincts to stop bad habits in their tracks. Through the techniques she offers in this conversation, people can get through a breakup or a rough patch at work without it knocking them back. As she’ll explain, the trick is always to look for patterns in your own behaviour, and the story you tell yourself about your own behaviour, and your own past. Because it’s only when setbacks affect the narrative you tell you about yourself that they can become a trauma. Control the narrative, and your ability to direct the course of your own life comes easily. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/Sew3KrnPIqb Dr Julie - https://www.instagram.com/drjulie/?hl=en https://www.tiktok.com/@drjuliesmith?lang=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E149: How I Taught Millions Of Women The Most Important Skill: Girls Who Code Founder: Reshma Saujani</title>
      <description>Reshma is the founder of Girls Who Code, one of the most influential non-profits in the world which has introduced millions of women to coding and the tech industry. She is also the author of Pay Up, a book about how to get women further in the workplace. Reshma was initially a prophet of the thinking that women could have it all, if only they tried twice as hard as everyone else they could achieve anything they wanted to. Now, she’s changed her mind. Trying to run an organisation with over 500 employees while looking after a young family full-time simply proved too much. Women simply have too much stacked against them having to juggle work and family life to properly pursue their careers without special consideration. What really stands out about Reshma is the fact that having built an enterprise that was on its way to changing the world, she had the humility to change her mind about major parts of her philosophy. Reshma’s story is one of how to realise and bounce back from your mistakes, no matter who you are or how far you’ve come. It takes a lot of courage to do that, but courage is something that Reshma has never had in short supply. Topics: Growing up as an immigrant University dept Running for congress Starting Girls Who Code The difficult parts of building girls who code What would you have done differently? Fixing the system not the women How is your mental health? How do you decide what to say yes or no to? Empowering women in a practical way What does success look like in your future? The last guests question Reshma: https://www.instagram.com/reshmasaujani/ https://twitter.com/reshmasaujani Reshma’s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pay-Up-Future-Women-Different/dp/1982191570 Girls Who Code: https://girlswhocode.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl Vodafone Business - https://bit.ly/3NIM35n https://bit.ly/3AuPKsA

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This is a favourite moment of mine because its so obviously clear that we should all be taking time for ourselves when we never do. This is a moment from my episode with Jay Shetty, the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose and one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too - this being one of them. Meditation. A difficult one to get on board with. We always hear that we must meditate more, but we never really practice it. Why? Because it's too woo-woo, or time wasting. Well here, Jay explains how much meditation can add value to our lives. All we have to do is put a time in our schedule that is time for us. Even if it’s 5 minutes a day, when we get that notification, we have to do something with it. The second step of meditation and taking time for ourselves is focusing on our breath. It's wildly underestimated yet it's one of the most important aspects of the human body. Our breath is connected to every single emotion, physicality and mentality.Meditation and breath are the practical tools we all need in our daily lives.

      <title>E148: Strava Founder: How I Motivated 100 Million People To Stay Active: Michael Horvath </title>
      <description>Michael Horvath is the co-founder of Strava, the app to track and improve peoples fitness that’s used by millions of people worldwide. It’s his second business success, after he built a thriving online business in the 1990s. But it hasn’t all been plain sailing for Michael. Initially quitting his first business, he spent several years as a family man before boredom launched him into starting his second. What he didn’t appreciate is that his calling as a family man would come back for him in a way he could never have imagined. Michael took 5 years off from Strava to care for his wife until her tragic death, and then care for his children in the aftermath of that. When he returned to a struggling Strava as CEO in 2020, he had to build it again from the ground up. It was something he was ready equipped for, because it’s something he’s had to do many times before. Topics: What made you different? What role do you play in keeping life balance within your team Strava's journey  How does Strava motivate people to stay healthy and fit? How did the pandemic impact your work community? What were the hardest challenges you faced when starting up? Work-life balance &amp; stepping down  What did you learn from the passing of your wife Returning to Strava Difficult moments in Strava Michael: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtkhorvath/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>E147: FBI’s Top Hostage Negotiator: The Art Of Negotiating To Get Whatever You Want: Chris Voss</title>
      <description>Chris Voss is the former lead negotiator for the FBI, and the author of Never Split the Difference, a book about how to negotiate and how to get what you want from other people which has sold millions of copies worldwide. He has handled practically every high stakes crisis management scenario imaginable. What is unique about Chris’ technique is he emphasises seeing negotiation and deal making as a partnership, not a battle of wills. You only get what you want if you make an effort to understand what the other people really wants, and help them to understand what you want to. Making deals isn’t possible without a base of human-to-human connection. In this conversation Chris opens up about a number of different type of dynamics we have to negotiate in our daily lives, from romantic relationships to friendships. We also get the inside scoop on what it’s like to handle some of the toughest situations, from bank robberies to hostage crises, anyone can imagine. What he learnt is that managing relations with other people is really about trying to help them, and all of us can do with a little of the help Chris brings us in this conversation. Topics: Early years Beginning of your career The nature of human behaviour in business negotiations The first hostage negotiation job Hostage negotiation role play How important is it to listen? Different tone of voices for negotiations “labelling their pain” The power of “thats right” Negotiations in romantic relationships Was there an instants where it didn’t go right for you? Mirroring technique Black-swan group The last guests question Chris: https://www.instagram.com/thefbinegotiator/ Chris’ book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/1847941494 Books mention: Start with NO...The Negotiating Tools that the Pros Don't Want You to Know - https://www.amazon.com/Start-Negotiating-Tools-that-Pros/dp/0609608002 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 59 - What To Tell People Who Are Stuck In Their Job: James Smith</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. James Smith is a bestselling author of Not A Life Coach and Not A Diet Book where he combines hard truths and empathy to his fans. He is also a personal trainer and fitness influencer with a unique philosophy that makes his message unlike any fitness advice you’ve ever heard before. Here he talks about the way ‘out’. Whether that is the way out of a job, a relationship or a situation we are always so hesitant to follow through with our gut instincts. We are all here to live and time isn’t something we can friverously throw away. He mentions the phrase “you’re a long time dead”, and it's something he tells himself regularly. I hope this moment will give you that push to do the thing you’ve been wanting to do. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/xtr8UWEKlqb James - https://www.instagram.com/jamessmithpt/?hl=en https://twitter.com/jamessmithPT_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E146: Tom Bilyeu: From Broke &amp; Sleeping On The Floor To A $1 Billion Business</title>
      <description>Tom Bilyeu is the host of Impact Theory, one of the biggest podcasts in the world, and the co-founder of Quest Nutrition, the company that’s now valued at over $1 billion which revolutionised protein bars and supplements and was, for a time, the second highest-growing company in North America. It took Tom a long time to find something he was good at that he enjoyed. Tom was sleeping on mattresses and friends' floors, now he’s a multi-millionaire. Why? Because he says you can literally remould your brain to what you want. Laying out his controversial theory in more detail than he ever has before, Tom also goes into how to find personal fulfillment that satisfies YOUR needs, how to take personal responsibility. In a conversation you don’t want to miss, Tom reveals all about his journey to personal happiness, and yours. Topics: How did you become the successful person you are today? Anxiety How to improve people's mental health How do you find fulfillment? The importance of personal responsibility How do you get out of difficult situations? Where are we heading and how would you solve future global problems? How to keep a healthy &amp; long term relationship Is there a place where you don't feel anxiety? Our last guest's question Tom: https://twitter.com/tombilyeu https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu Mentioned books: Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order - Ray Dalio https://www.amazon.com/Changing-World-Order-Nations-Succeed/dp/1982160276/ A Long Walk to Freedom - Nelson Mandela https://www.amazon.com/Long-Walk-Freedom-Autobiography-Mandela/dp/0349106533/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx Vodafone Business - https://bit.ly/3NIM35n https://bit.ly/3AuPKsA

      <title>Moment 58 - How To Improve your Life in 5 Seconds: Mel Robbins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I’ve chosen a section from my conversation with Mel Robbins. Mel is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with huge amounts of depression, anxiety, and fear, making it extremely difficult for her to get out of bed in the morning and generally just be present in her life. This moment describes the method that has changed Mel’s mindset to become who she is today. Mel got herself out of her dark side which saw her marinating in fear and anxiety, using her Five Second Rule. The rule was born from that window of hesitation that comes into our minds before we make a decision, a decision that could define your whole life. Inside that window lives fear, anxiety, procrastination and imposter syndrome, so we create patterns of feeling, patterns of behaviour, and patterns of thinking that tempt us to steer away from making that decision. It can be a dangerous cycle getting stuck in these broken patterns of denial so Mel brings this down to one fundamental method. The Five Second rule works because of its simplicity. You make yourself a promise, you count backwards - 5,4,3,2,1 then you do it. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/94zhHbl49pb Mel - https://www.instagram.com/melrobbins/?hl=en https://twitter.com/melrobbins?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Moment 57 - Why You Need To Forget About The End Result: Sir David Brailsford</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. David Brailsford is the Team Principal of INEOS and is the main behind the ‘marginal gains’ philosophy, which can be applied in life and business more broadly, that paying attention to the tiniest details, no matter how small, can add up and together produce a big difference.

Here David puts us inside the minds of real champions and reveals the best ways to prepare for events and really place ourselves in the moment.

Here David puts us inside the minds of real champions and reveals the best ways to prepare for events and really place ourselves in the moment. Forgetting about the end result and rooting ourselves in the here and now are key. It might sound hard, but David has made it his business to train people for the biggest stages for twenty years.

      <title>E142: Matthew Hussey: The Secret To Building A Perfect Relationship</title>
      <description>Matthew Hussey is one of the world’s most renowned experts on relationships and human connection. He’s not only helped thousands of people be more ready to meet the love of their life, but also how to have a meaningful relationship with them when you do. In this conversation Matthew doesn’t just offer advice, but opens up about how he’s approached relationships in his own life. He freely admits mistakes he’s made, where his approach went wrong, and what he’s learnt. This is some of the most mature and reflective relationship advice I think I’ve ever heard. Because Matthew doesn’t just specialise in how to prepare for the good moments, but how to deal with the bad ones as well. Topics: Your insecurities How do we know when our ego is driving? What makes people feel disconnected The positive impact of personal responsibility The value of lessons learnt from previous trauma How to control emotions to bring yourself to a place of peace Learning to show vulnerabilities Why do partners trying to change us? Are you scared of being bored in your relationship? Do we have to be in the right place personally for a successful relationship? The last guests question Matthew: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HGzFGt7BLmWDqooUbWGBg https://www.instagram.com/thematthewhussey/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <description>Payal is the founder of Classpass, the app that’s helped millions of users find their passion. Her own love of dancing encouraged her to start a business which enabled anyone, anywhere to find something they loved to do.

Payal grew up in a home where her mother often wasn’t home, working late-night shifts to keep her family going. How far Payal has come. Today she shares exactly how she got there. The sheer determination with which she ruthlessly sets her goals and priorities, and then systematically chases after them with everything she’s got, was hugely inspiring to me, and I’m sure it will be to you too. Topics: What made you different? Batling between your passion and 9-5 job Rebelling for your purpose Changing careers and finding new communities Confidence, purpose, and drive to success Why did you start ClassPass? What difficulties did you face starting your business? Living in line with your values What were you like as a manager? Why did you step away from Classpass? Work and family balance Therapy sessions Our last guest’s question Payal: https://twitter.com/payalkadakia https://www.instagram.com/payal Payal's book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/LifePass-Groundbreaking-Approach-Goal-Setting/dp/1399706756 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl Vodafone Business - https://bit.ly/3NIM35n https://bit.ly/3AuPKsA

      <title>Moment 56 - The Only Way To Build Confidence: Jacqueline Gold</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Jaqueline Gold has been the CEO of AnnSummers for over thirty years, and has had to overcome a lot of demons and obstacles in her life. But the attitude she’s employed to tackle these is nothing short of incredible. In this moment, Jacqueline discusses how shy she first was and she overcame that. She reiterated here that we aren’t born shy. It’s often our situational environments that create and shape who we are later on. No matter how shy or inverted we are, everyone has a fire inside them, an ambition and a burning desire to do what they believe is right. Jacqueline is a great believer that courage comes first, it forces you out of your comfort zone, and when you do this, confidence will come and great things will happen.

      <title>E139: Jessie J: I Quit Music, Deleted An Album, Then Changed My Mind</title>
      <description>Jessie J is a singer and songwriter who has been singing professionally since she was 11 years old. In 2010 she shot to fame with the release of her first single, Do It Like A Dude. She has since sold millions of records, performed at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and been a judge on the talent shows The Voice and The Voice Kids. This episode with Jessie is a special conversation. She was candid and open about the highs and lows throughout her life, and shared with me some things that she has never voiced before. From her early childhood memories, to the fame and success of her music, to health issues and grief, Jessie spoke with such honesty and tenderness. But she also talks about how she has enabled herself to break open and embrace the grief that she has stored up and hidden away. Jessie is someone who has always come out fighting, and here she goes into how that’s been possible in a way she never has before. We learn about how to stay grounded as you become famous, especially in the dizzying swirl of Los Angeles. I want to thank Jessie for her honesty and for taking the time to record this episode with me, it will certainly change how you think about a lot of things in life. Topics: My childhood and health problems Growth in moments of sadness and pain Finding out about your fertility problems Dealing with everything hitting you at once What would you say to your old self? Not knowing who I was Were record labels defining who you were? Finding the right team for you Why did you disappear? How did the pandemic impact you? Jamal Edwards passing Your miscarriage Your bodyguard’s passing Do you let people in? Love and relationships What’s your next chapter?

In 2010 she shot to fame with the release of her first single, Do It Like A Dude. She has since sold millions of records, performed at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and been a judge on the talent shows The Voice and The Voice Kids. This episode with Jessie is a special conversation. She was candid and open about the highs and lows throughout her life, and shared with me some things that she has never voiced before. From her early childhood memories, to the fame and success of her music, to health issues and grief, Jessie spoke with such honesty and tenderness. But she also talks about how she has enabled herself to break open and embrace the grief that she has stored up and hidden away. Jessie is someone who has always come out fighting, and here she goes into how that’s been possible in a way she never has before. We learn about how to stay grounded as you become famous, especially in the dizzying swirl of Los Angeles. I want to thank Jessie for her honesty and for taking the time to record this episode with me, it will certainly change how you think about a lot of things in life. Topics: My childhood and health problems Growth in moments of sadness and pain Finding out about your fertility problems Dealing with everything hitting you at once What would you say to your old self? Not knowing who I was Were record labels defining who you were? Finding the right team for you Why did you disappear? How did the pandemic impact you? Jamal Edwards passing Your miscarriage Your bodyguard’s passing Do you let people in? Love and relationships What’s your next chapter?

      <title>Moment 55 - This Method Will Boost Your Productivity: Ali Abdaal</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week I’m bringing back an episode from August last year with Ali Abdaal; a doctor, business entrepreneur, public speaker and all-round expert. It is important to resurface these ideas about productivity so that we can get the most out of our lives. This was an incredibly engaging conversation, as he tells me how he manages to squeeze every moment from his day. Ali mentions here that in order to do our tasks in the most efficient way, we should shift our mindset to think they are fun. This means that we become intrinsically motivated to complete them. One way in which we can do this is change ‘I have to…’ to ‘I get to…’. Shifting our mind to think that something is fun, will make us feel so much better about ourselves once the task is done. I also mentioned that when I have my own time to choose when I can be productive, I create time sensitive and task specific blocks in my mind. This helps to create a tick box mentality, and one which I can intertwine with what Ali says here.

      <title>E138: Terry Crews: How My Porn Addiction Nearly Ended My Marriage</title>
      <description>Terry Crews is a NFL player turned film and TV star, featuring in a wide range of hugely successful shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, White Chicks, Everybody Hates Chris and Idiocracy. Escaping his abusive father, and spending decades cultivating his bodybuilder physique and mentality, Terry then broke into the Hollywood scene. This episode is the Terry Crews we have never seen before. We talk about some extremely deep, raw material and explore his deeply personal story of his childhood which led him into an addiction to appearing outwardly tough. His journey to where he is now is inspiring and the way he speaks about it is so humbling. Certain areas of his life that became out of control such as violence, sex, relationships, racism, shame, made him learn how to seek control of himself and his environment. His latest book, Tough: My Journey to True Power, is a moving autobiography where Terry faces these insecurities and distressing memories. Topics: What made you the person you are today? Domestic violence in your family Where did your dad's pain come from ? My pornography addiction How did porn impact your marriage? Cheating on my wife Opening up to my wife and its consequences Why do men avoid intimacy and vulnerability ? What was your lowest moment ? Your dad being aggressive in front of your children How and why did you change? How would your life be if you wouldn't have changed ? I was sexually assaulted by a Hollywood executive How my dark and bright side came from the same place Our last guest's question Terry Crews: https://twitter.com/terrycrews https://www.instagram.com/terrycrews Terry's book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tough-My-Journey-True-Power/dp/0593329805/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1651096152&amp;sr=8-2 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>E137: Piers Morgan: Dealing With Repeat Failure, Death Threats &amp; Regrets</title>
      <description>Piers Morgan is a journalist and television host who hasn't stayed out of the headlines since being made the youngest newspaper editor in Britain when he took over the News of the World at the age of 28, almost 30 years ago. Over the years he has attracted controversy for his disputed tactics in breaking news stories and television interviews. He is also the author of several best-selling memoirs. His long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC. Some of the shows include Piers Morgan Life Stories, Good Morning Britain, Britain’s Got Talent, and his newest - Piers Morgan Uncensored, beginning April 24 on the new TalkTv. In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism. You may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about. Piers believes his voice of common sense, acts as a vital counter-narrative to have in society and encourages us to build resilience, stimulate debate and stop over labelling things. Topics: What made you the person we see today? Mental resilience vs mental health How did you get ahead so quickly in your career? Marketing yourself using controversy How have you dealt with your ups and downs? What would it take for you and Meghan Markle to make up? The effect your media appearance has on your children When does Piers Morgan cry?

      <title>Moment 54 - How You Should Make Every Big Decision: Rochelle Humes</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I have chosen a clip from my episode with Rochelle Humes, who spoke to me so openly about her life, chasing the highest goals like never before. Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and is also the entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco. Rochelle found success by being true to herself, and following her instincts. We all know this can be hard to do, so here we talk about how to make those decisions easier. The 51% theory is something that I learnt off Barack Obama at a talk we both did in Brazil. It comes down to if we are always looking for 100% of the facts, data and certainty to get our decisions over the line, it leads to huge procrastination and time-wasting. Getting to that 51% is a much more efficient system, and it reassures us that it will be the right decision to make.

      <title>E135: Craig David Opens Up About His Painful Rise, Fall &amp; Redemption</title>
      <description>Craig David is a singer and DJ who has sold over 15 million records worldwide. With over 20 years in the music industry, he is one of the world’s best-known singers. But when he found his career falling away beneath him, Craig had to reinvent himself. Coming back with the incredibly popular TS5, Craig has risen to the top, fallen back and then rebuilt himself back to exactly where he left off. Nothing reveals the truth about yourself more than having it all and (most of it) being taken away. Craig had to dig deep and express what was true to himself, but first he had to find out what that meant. Topics: Your early years Your model of relationships Growing up on a council estate Your early music influences Your rise in music How were you dealing with your meteoric rise? Losing yourself Your mental health journey Being back and in a better place The last guests question Craig: https://www.instagram.com/craigdavid/ https://mobile.twitter.com/craigdavid Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 53 - Why Doing This Is More Important Than Ever Before: Johann Hari</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Johann Hari, is the man behind multiple bestselling books speculating on depression, anxiety, happiness, and loneliness. In this clip, we talk about the important role spending time reading plays in our lives. We are so absorbed in the information that we see across social media because of the short and fast forms they are presented to us in. Whether that’s twitter posts or Instagram captions, the medium of these messages make us impatient when it comes to reading a book. Johann calls it screen inferiority which diminishes our ability to retain information. He explains that instead of skimming (or scrolling) across loads of things, we need to take a bit of time to think about one thing. Slowing down, looking at one bit and spending time thinking about what you are actually reading is how we are going to increase our engagement. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/9vzo9qSXdpb Johann - https://twitter.com/johannhari101?lang=en https://www.instagram.com/johann.hari/ Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E134: The Single Biggest Killer Of Relationships: Lewis Howes</title>
      <description>Lewis is the host of The School of Greatness podcast and the author of The Mask of Masculinity. An icon of American self-development, Lewis’ podcast has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, and helped hundreds of millions of people. But the first person Lewis had to help is himself. Someone who always ran towards things that made him feel safe, whether that be towards working out, towards the need to get girls to like him, or away from his trauma. But an outside injury, and a reckoning with his inside trauma, meant Lewis had to start from zero. What strikes me about Lewis is someone who’s come so far after his life was turned upside down. When his world was spinning around, Lewis saw the way forwards. Topics: Healing my childhood trauma What were the dynamics with your parents? What was the impact of your dad’s accident on you? Importance of communicating with your parents Learning the art of emotional regulation / Allowing myself to be vulnerable changed my life Why I didn’t compromise my core values (and being honest in your relationships) The power of honesty in relationships Knowing your values and vision Balancing work and relationships Biggest killer of relationships Overcoming my fear of public speaking How do I find meaning and happiness? Why does helping people matter to you?

      <title>E133: Karren Brady: How To Win At Entrepreneurship &amp; Love (at the same time)</title>
      <description>Karren Brady is a businesswoman, Vice Chairman of West Ham, a mainstay on BBC One’s The Apprentice for many years, and at the age of 23 became the youngest person to run a publicly traded company when she was put in charge of Birmingham City Football Club. Not only was she the youngest person running a football club, but she was also one of the first women to be leaders in the industry. It is hard to imagine not only being one of the youngest people at the club you’re running, but one of the only women too. What has underlined these advances is incredible energy, dedication and drive. For Karren, breaking glass ceilings and being a first to do things is reachable for everyone, it just means working twice as hard as everyone else. Early years How independence led me to success What made you stand out? What was the skill that made you stand out? My first big deal What was different about you? Importance of being candid in business Democracy within your business Running West Ham United F.C Do emotions compromise your decisions Should clubs be more transparent? Work and life balance Sexism in football and the workplace Your relationships Is there a need to maintain desire? Have you experienced anxiety? Feminism &amp; your milestones What's your advice to young women Karren: https://twitter.com/karren_brady https://www.instagram.com/karren_brady_official Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl Vodafone Business - https://bit.ly/3Nagd1l

      <title>Moment 52 - Why You Need To Be Kinder To Yourself: Fearne Cotton</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Fearne Cotton is an author, presenter and podcast host with a goal to help all of her listeners find their own happy place. In this clip, we talk about one section of her book that hones in on the idea of being more self-compassionate. It's something I’ve spoken about a lot, talking about this voice inside our heads that talks to us. What Fearne says here is that we need to choose what we listen to, and what we focus on. We need to focus on the stuff that we like about ourselves and the things that we really want to celebrate. It’s a matter of where we put our attention and focus, and that is a hard practical discipline that we need to work on. It’s so important that we learn to become more self-compassionate. I hope listening to Fearne’s episode will move you in the right direction.

      <title>E132: Wretch 32: How To Build Unstoppable Self-Belief </title>
      <description>Wretch 32 is a British rapper and the co-founder of Green Machine, a company that specialises in CBD products. One of the leading rappers of his generation, he is noted for his especially personal lyrics that movingly convey his making a better life for himself, as well as his relationship with those around him, especially his mother. With every line and every bar he wrote, Wretch pulled his way out of his Tottenham estate and the circumstances he was born into. Growing up surrounded by gang conflict, Wretch has had to navigate right and wrong in a world that sometimes seemed upside down. But what’s fascinating about Wretch is he didn’t move away or let success lead him into a new life. Instead, he stayed in Tottenham. Because he didn’t want success to change him, who his people were, and what was important to him. Topics: Your Early Years Your beginnings as an artist How did you know you were going to succeed? How did it feel to reach your dream? Rap culture and materialism Staying true to yourself Impact of media pressure Imposter Syndrome Your CBD business Working with Def Jam Recordings Your relationships The modern music industry Influences Our last guest's question Wretch: https://www.instagram.com/officialwretch32/ https://twitter.com/wretch32 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>Moment 51 - Jordan Peterson: How Struggle Makes Us Stronger</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jordan Peterson tells us all about the importance of struggle. Presenting his controversial view, he says that we aren't born with our virtues, they're rather forged in adversity. Because it isn’t the destination, it's the journey that takes us there. What people don't know about Jordan is that he's from a small town, in an oil town where alcoholism is very prevalent. Out of this Jordan had to find himself, forge himself. The values he lives by today, the vow he took with his wife never to lie to her, the desire to conduct himself with integrity in all his actions, aren't abstract concepts, they're hard taught lessons. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/pVhukOYjQob Jordan - https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor https://www.jordanbpeterson.com Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Moment 50 - The Most Common Misconceptions About Sleep: Stephanie Romiszewski</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I want to bring back to you a section from this incredible conversation I had with Stephanie Romiszewski, an experienced sleep physiologist and expert in developing bespoke treatment plans for sleep problems. Here we discuss the common misconceptions many people have about sleep, including the much perceived importance of getting those 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Her main piece of advice denotes that perfection is the enemy of the good; dictating our bedtime is the worst thing we can do to ourselves, and instead we should focus on the quality over the quantity of sleep and never expect to get that solid 8 hours that we have all been told to get. Finding a reasonable sleep routine, and maintaining it will allow our bodies to regulate and rest, which will eventually train the brain to use our sleep window as a sleep opportunity. Such an overload of misconceptions can go wrong, and cause even more panic for people who have become crippled by their sleep patterns. We often forget how efficient our bodies are, so we need to stop worrying about sleep debt and instead focus on a good routine.Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/OrX6sjtZEob Stephanie- https://twitter.com/sleepyclinic https://sleepyheadclinic.co.uk/stephanie-romiszewski-sleep-expert/ Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

Her main piece of advice denotes that perfection is the enemy of the good; dictating our bedtime is the worst thing we can do to ourselves, and instead we should focus on the quality over the quantity of sleep and never expect to get that solid 8 hours that we have all been told to get. Finding a reasonable sleep routine, and maintaining it will allow our bodies to regulate and rest, which will eventually train the brain to use our sleep window as a sleep opportunity. Such an overload of misconceptions can go wrong, and cause even more panic for people who have become crippled by their sleep patterns. We often forget how efficient our bodies are, so we need to stop worrying about sleep debt and instead focus on a good routine.Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/OrX6sjtZEob Stephanie- https://twitter.com/sleepyclinic https://sleepyheadclinic.co.uk/stephanie-romiszewski-sleep-expert/ Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E127: Jaackmaate: The Untold Story Of My Battle With Health Anxiety &amp; OCD</title>
      <description>Jaackmate is the host of the popular Happy Hour podcast and a youtuber with over one million subscribers. From humble beginnings in Norwich to one of the largest internet personalties working in Britain today, Jack has had a hell of a ride. But more thought goes into Jack’s comedy and its targets than you might think. Because Jack doesn’t just mock anyone, but is always interrogating himself as to whether he’s mocking the right targets, and whether there’s a sufficient ‘why?’ to everything he does. His ride to the top hasn’t been easy either, and Jack has had to overcome challenges he never expected along the way. From anxiety to dealing with criticism, Jack gives us the truth about inventing, and then reinventing, yourself on the internet. Topics: Your early years Your fake Youtube persona Your YouTube journey and losing motivation Does money buy happiness Imposter syndrome Why stopped posting on Youtube Have you ever thought about the person on the other side of your criticism? Happy Hour Podcast Health Anxiety Your partner Whats the reason you’re sitting here today?

      <title>Moment 49 - How To Form Habits That Actually Stick: Professor Steve Peters</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this one, I’m taking a section from Steve Peters, a doctor, psychiatrist, professor and mental coach for the world's top athletes and business leaders. Here he shares his wisdom about how we can form healthy habits and ways in which to maintain them. He explains that habits can be formed both consciously, based on our belief system, and unconsciously, the ones we aren’t knowingly thinking about. When we look to battle those good habits from the bad, it is not straightforward, and they need to be subdivided. Steve is the author of “The Chimp Paradox”, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and put forward the groundbreaking ‘Chimp model’ for understanding how our brains work. The model focuses on the 3 parts of the brain and he talks briefly about one of them here. The ‘Chimp’ which is our desire to be irrational, emotional, impulsive and short-term. Basing habits on our beliefs and experiences is letting the Chimp make those decisions, and sometimes we need to connect the other parts of our brain; the ‘Human’ and the ‘Computer’ to manage and control the interaction they have with habits.

      <title>E125: How To Finally Stop Procrastinating: Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <description>Oliver Burkeman is the author of Four Thousand Weeks, a book that offers the most interesting perspective on how to manage your time that I’ve ever heard. He was a columnist for the Guardian newspaper for twenty years. The key lesson of Oliver’s book is what prioritisation really means. Make a list of the twenty-five things you want to do in your life, and then forget items 6-25, try and carve out some time every single day to work on your passion. It seems simple, but if it was more people would do it. We fill our lives with busywork in order to distract ourselves from the reality that our time is running out. This shocking insight is the key to understanding Oliver’s unique approach to achieve focus, and you might just gain some perspective along the way. Topics: Why do you write about happiness? Happiness and meaning Embracing our limits Why do we put our happiness on the future? Pursuit of efficiency Living up to your external reputation Procrastination How to prioritise The water melon problem Why self analysis is so important Why do we purse ambition over happiness We’re addicted to the speed of life Embracing small changes Embracing our irrelevance A question from your book The last guest question Oliver’s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Time-How Oliver: https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 48 - 3 Core Principles For A Better Life: Mark Manson</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Mark Manson has sold over 13 million books, and is the genius behind ‘The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck’ and ‘Everything is F*cked’. His advice here is so simple, yet so moving and easily applicable to our everyday lives. For Mark, becoming a better person requires these three principles. Dealing with responsibility, making choices and managing expectations are at the core of our personal development and all interlink. If there’s no personal responsibility for our choices, nothing else is ever going to work or improve. Accepting responsibility, will allow us to move away from the danger of disempowering ourselves to progress. In turn, if we can make those better choices, and take responsibility, our expectations will naturally align.

      <title>E124: Phones 4u Founder: The Pain Of Becoming A Billionaire: John Caudwell</title>
      <description>John Caudwell is one of the richest people in the UK, for many years he has been the UK’s highest-paying taxpayer. Making his money on the back of the mobile phone revolution, he is worth £3 billion. And he has built his fortune from nothing. Growing up in a sometimes unstable household, John ran his first business while working full time as an apprentice mechanic. His energy and drive sustained him throughout his money-making journey. But this single-minded determination came at a cost. He sacrified friends and a social life, and has called his experience founding Phones 4u “twenty years of grief”. Perhaps no one has been more open with me about what it took to build their empire, and what it ultimately took from them. Topics: Your early years What techniques have helped you become self-aware? Criticism vs recognition with employees What skills made you great in business? How does one build resilience Your hardest moments in business What was the cost of building businesses? When was the moment you decided to give away your wealth? Your child falling ill What have you learnt about what actually matters? Romantic relationships The last guests question John: https://www.instagram.com/johncaudwell/ https://twitter.com/JohnDCaudwell Caudwell Children: https://www.caudwellchildren.com/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Follow us on Telegram: https://t.me/diaryofaceo Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx

      <title>Moment 47 - The Power of Good Communication: Nick Jenkins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. In this moment, Nick shares his wisdom with us on the importance of having good communication skills from public speaking to stand-out graphics and polished writing. Your ability to articulate yourself, think coherently and coerce a logical argument is vital to all walks of life whether that is business related or not. People often think that to be a good communicator you have to nail those public speaking events, but what Nick notes is that actually we practice articulating ourselves everyday. Making eye contact, engaging in conversations and listening to people are all things we can do. The more we output, whether that be speaking, writing or drawing the better we naturally become at communicating with people. We compare this to sales because at the baseline, we are always selling ourselves to people we meet, persuading others that we are the best. Nick is an incredible guy who leans on the power of composing yourself well in front of others in order to succeed.

      <title>E121: Matt Hancock: Opens Up About His Affair, Mistakes &amp; The Pandemic</title>
      <description>Matthew Hancock is the MP for West Suffolk, the former Secretary of State for Health, and was responsible for leading the country through the COVID-19 pandemic until his time as Health Secretary was brought controversially to an end in summer 2021. For the first time, Matt speaks candidly on what it was like to lead a country through a once-in-a-century pandemic, and the circumstances surrounding his resignation. When I started this podcast, I wanted to bring you conversations that allow us to see behind the scenes, to give the context and this conversation is no different. You do not have to agree with Matt but I think after this episode today we will have the answers we’ve all been waiting for. This is not your typical political interview. This is a conversation that definitely needed to happen. Topics: Why did you want to have this conversation here? Your early years Diversity in politics Why did you get into politics and why would you want to? How can you be the minister for all these different areas? You running for Prime Minister When covid hit What was your life like at that time? If you’d known a pandemic would roll in would you have taken the health secretary job? The care home mistake Isn’t our high number of deaths an indicator that wrong decisions were made? The first vaccine - showing your emotions The CCTV footage The parties at number 10 Dominic Cummings Your Dyslexia campaign Do you feel like you’ve addressed what you wanted to from this conversation? The last guest question   Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Sponsors: Huel - https://my.huel.com/Steven Craftd - https://bit.ly/3JKOPFx Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 46 - A Tribute To Jamal Edwards</title>
      <description>Jamal Edwards: A true legend, role model and friend. In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast I usually pick one of my favourite moments across all the episodes, but this week after the heartbreaking news of Jamal’s passing I wanted to collate the best bits of our conversation into a mini montage as a dedication to the prodigious person he was. I hope we can all live in the legacy he left behind. Jamal Edwards played a huge role in my life, he was someone that I admired and looked up to tremendously. He paved the way and proved to young black men like me that I could become successful and achieve big things. Jamal is the founder of SBTV, the first new media business on YouTube, which is hugely successful, and plays a role in launching the careers of many, many people in the music industry, including Ed Sheeran. He talks here about the dimensions of being an entrepreneur, and how the mistakes we make often create the biggest hurdles to overcome and learn from. His wisdom and maturity are inspiring to listen to and as we delve into the subject of achieving happiness, he says his own happiness comes from being able to give back, to improve other people’s lives and to give people the confidence and self-belief he wished he had. We recorded this clip over a year ago, and I wanted to share with you moments from it that capture his genuine empathy, charisma and diligence. Rest in peace brother. Episode 39 - https://g2ul0.app.link/voBhicG5Snb

      <description>James Smith is a bestselling author of Not A Life Coach and Not A Diet Book, and a personal trainer and fitness influencer with a unique philosophy that makes his message unlike any fitness advice you’ve ever heard before. James combines hard truths, he’s not afraid of saying words like ‘fat’, and an extra level of connection and empathy with his clients, he begins by asking them how many hours a week they can commit, and works around them. He has high expectations that work around you. James is a special guy, and he didn’t hold back in this conversation. Fitness is a world where there’s a lot of bad advice, a lot of contradictory opinions, and it can be hard to tell the wood from the trees. For the plain facts on how to take your fitness to the next level, James is the fitness expert for you.

      <title>Moment 45 - Why 80% Of Relationships Don't Work: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode, we go back to a moment from one of my favourite episodes with Mo Gawdat. We discuss something that I like to bring up with a lot of my guests; how to maintain love and keep relationships healthy. The way Mo speaks about his previous partner is phenomenal and should be a lesson to us all mentioning that he still admires her spirituality, love and wisdom. Mo explains that reaching this level of maturity in meaningful relationships requires work, trust and a total understanding of each other. Finding love and keeping love are not the same thing. In this moment listen to become a better person in your relationships. Episode 101 - https://g2ul0.app.link/9MCCcFlLnmb  Mo: https://twitter.com/MGawdat? https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?... Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <description>Jay Shetty is the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose, spiritual friend to celebrities from Ellen Degeneres to Oprah Winfrey, and a former monk. Jay is one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too. I definitely was able to put things into perspective in this conversation. Jay has a way of linking very practical advice to really profound insights about life. This conversation went in so many unexpected directions and was definitely one of the discussions I've found most personally valuable. Jay, thank you for sharing your wisdom with us. Your early years How to deal with subconscious behaviour patterns The Importance of surrounding yourself with good values You’re a very good quitter Why do people label themselves in a certain way? Meditation Where do people start with Meditation, breathing techniques Good fear &amp; bad fear What do we want to improve personally? What can I do to have an impact on someones life? What do we require for a happy life? Your partnership with Calm Why was Jay Shetty successful?

      <title>Moment 43 - The Key To Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This particular moment was taken from an episode where I asked you guys to send in questions you wanted answering. This one really stood out to me as its a question I get so often, yet I think people are looking at imposter syndrome in completely the wrong way. Facing the feeling of being outside our comfort zone is a challenge to overcome, but with the right mindset we can turn those nerves around into something positive. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, my evidence and interpretation of this nervousness tells me I am ready to do the thing that is instinctively making you anxious. Despite associating imposter syndrome with fear, I strongly believe that it is a good feeling to have. Growth requires us to step outside of our comfort zone, to push ourselves and expand our abilities. Each time you do this, the next time will be just that little bit easier. What people call imposter syndrome is a sign you're exactly where you are supposed to be. Though short I felt this was a moment that couldn't be missed. Episode 103 - https://g2ul0.app.link/oMH2Vkboinb Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1

      <title>E117: Calm App Founder: From $0 To $2 Billion By Making The World Meditate: Michael Acton Smith</title>
      <description>Michael Acton-Smith is best known as the co-founder of Calm, the $2 billion meditation, sleep and wellness app, but he is so much more than that. Because Calm is just one of four companies Michael has built.   Michael has also built Moshi Monsters, the breakout success web-based children’s game, which after rapid growth suffered a loss in users and for a while Michael wasn’t sure whether the business could survive. Michael has experienced the highs, but also the challenges, of growing big businesses.    These are just two of four companies Michael has built. Michael is a natural entrepreneur who’s been founding businesses his entire adult life. To talk to him and share in his wisdom was a privilege I’m immensely grateful for.     Your early years Starting my first business - Firebox  My second business - Perplex City  My third business - Moshi monsters  The start of Calm Calm helping people sleep Misconceptions around sleep Tough times for you this year What you are doing now to change? Your relationships The foundations of good communication  How accurate is the 'hippie' stigma that comes with mindfulness?  Do you feel the good you've done in the world? Psychedelics curing mental health Our last guest question    Micheal: https://www.instagram.com/michaelacton/ https://twitter.com/acton?lang=gu  linkedin.com/in/michaelactonsmith/?originalSubdomain=uk  Calm: https://www.calm.com/    Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos         Sponsors:  Huel - https://uk.huel.com/  Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 42 - These 3 Things Will Make You Successful In Life: Jamil Qureshi</title>
      <description>Jamil Quresh is a high performance expert and psychologist. he's worked with some of the biggest businesses, sports teams and individuals to help them reach the highest level of performance. In my mind Jamil's episode was probably one of the most valuable I've recorded. I struggle to think of a better encapsulation we’ve received of self progression and how to always have an attitude in life open to learning. This is the episode to listen to if you want to learn how to better take responsibility in your own life, but more importantly what that means for your wider attitude. Especially having an open mind and being willing to experiment and try new things. I learn from all of my guests, but I think what Jamil taught me is how to learn better. This is definitely an episode for you if you feel like you’ve recently been stuck or like life isn’t throwing up the opportunities you want. Because it isn’t just the opportunities you receive, but the ones you look for, and how ready you are for them when they arrive. Episode 61 - https://g2ul0.app.link/w3n4SIUN6mb Jamil: Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamil-qureshi-494661a/ Twitter: @Jamil_Qureshi Website: www.jamilqureshi.com Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1

      <title>Moment 41 - The Reason You’re Feeling Stuck: Mel Robbins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Mel Robbins is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. Mel also runs a seven figure business which provides courses in self-improvement and life coaching. One of the most sought after motivational speakers in the world, Mel managed to turn around her boring, grey life into one that takes her all over the world meeting all types of inspiring people. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with depression, couldn’t get out of bed in the morning and generally just felt stuck in her life. Since then she’s been on a journey to understand why she felt like that and what actions needed to be taken to get her out of that place. Today Mel uses those experiences of being in a dark place and dives into the reasons we might feel stuck in certain circumstances. She brings it down to one fundamental reason and what you can do practically to get yourself out of a situation that isn’t serving you.

      <title>E115: The “Winning Expert”: How To Become The Best You Can Be: Sir David Brailsford</title>
      <description>Sir David Brailsford is the former Performance Director of British Cycling and current Team Principal of the Ineos Grenadiers, a professional cycling team that, along with its direct predecessor Team Sky, have won seven Tour De France titles since 2012. David is behind the business and life philosophy of ‘marginal gains’, a belief that paying attention to every little detail, and then trying to improve it by 1%, will have massive compound benefits when added together. Before David arrived at British Cycling, Britain was a relative backwater in the cycling world. Within a few years, he oversaw a team that won 8 out of 10 track medals at the olympic games. In this interview David opens up about the good times, and also the criticism he’s received, like never before. Topics: Your early years Getting into cycling Helping people find their motivation C.O.R.E First principles Forgetting about the result How to build motivation after victory? How to make tough decisions Marginal gains The cost of your obsession Your cancer scare Undergoing Heart surgery Individual approach vs team approach Struggling with failure The last guests question David's Team: https://twitter.com/INEOSGrenadiers https://www.instagram.com/ineosgrenadiers/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Our episode with Steve Peters: https://g2ul0.app.link/jus5h9GsOmb Sponsors: Huel - https://uk.huel.com/ Myenergi - https://bit.ly/3oeWGnl

      <title>Moment 40 - The Solution To All Of Your Problems</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week we’re jumping back to episode 47, a solo episode where I talk about a simple solution that can help us get out of our own heads and overcome a tough situation. If you ever feel trapped by your circumstances, this is the podcast for you. What’s crucial to understand is that you can’t control your environment, but you can control how you deal with it. It’s through hard and challenging experiences that I’ve been able to build my own resilience using these methods. I want this podcast to go out to someone out there who’s in a similar situation but doesn’t know what to do.

      <title>E114: How To Fix Your Focus &amp; Stop Procrastinating: Johann Hari</title>
      <description>Johann Hari is a journalist and author of Lost Connections, a book which changed the way I think about depression and mental health. His new book, Stolen Focus, is about what people can do in order to improve their focus, and about what we can all do to stop our attention being robbed in a world of increasing distractions. Johann travels thousands of miles all over the world in order to complete his research, he’s spoken to experts on every continent and he’s come in to us about what he’s learnt on his journey. What Johann offers is not just practical advice for us all to take to improve our focus, but also what we can all do to change the way we interact with tech companies in order to make sure it never gets robbed again. Topics: Why did you write about focus What is the cost of losing our attention? Social Media Flow States What is the harm of interruption? The lack of sleep we all seem to be getting The importance of reading physical books Negativity bias Angry humans in an angry machine Is there hope? Food is messing up our focus Our last guests question Johann: https://twitter.com/johannhari101 https://www.instagram.com/johann.hari Johann’s book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1526620227/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_8XB8KP2V3XWR2JKY00GN Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Sponsor: Huel - https://uk.huel.com/

      <title>Moment 39 - Jimmy Carr: The Truth About Hard Work</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Jimmy Carr needs no introduction and is one of the biggest names in British comedy. Jimmy has hardly been off our screens for the last two decades. But what people may not know is that Jimmy has another side to him. When he was in mid-20s, Jimmy was in a boring office job, without much joy or direction in his life. But he set himself on a journey of self-improvement. Out of nowhere, he decided to quit and start again, the rest, as they say, is history. Hard work is something that in our society has developed a reputation for being toxic but what really is the truth about hard work? In this weeks moment episode Jimmy talks to us about the myths of hard work, this 'toxic' narrative and the importance of woking hard vs working smart. Episode 106 - https://g2ul0.app.link/AWljby1dzmb Jimmy: https://www.jimmycarr.com/ https://www.youtube.com/user/jimmycarrfans https://twitter.com/jimmycarr Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Moment 38 - Happiness Is A Choice: The Controversial Truth: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode we go back to a moment from one of my favourite episodes with Mo Gawdat. Mo has co-founded over 20 businesses, he’s the author of the ground-breaking ‘Solve for Happy’ and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the ‘moonshot factory’ where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots. But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the ‘happiness equation’, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more. Mo Gawdat’s episode simply blew me away. There were so many hard-hitting truths which he exposed about happiness, but this clip might just have the best of them all. Happiness is a choice. This is something not everyone is willing to accept. But as you’ll hear in this moment episode, you can only be happy once you choose to be.

      <title>E112: Gymshark CEO: How I Built A $1.5 Billion Business At 19: Ben Francis</title>
      <description>Ben Francis has achieved incredible success it is easy to forget how young he still is. Founding Gymshark, a leading gym wear brand, when he was still in his teens, the company is now worth over $1.5 billion. But it hasn’t always been easy for Ben. He is naturally shy and introverted, and public speaking is something that didn’t come naturally to him. Naturally resilient and sure of his mission, Ben had to learn how to transmit these feelings within himself to leading a top team. It took a lot of work and dedication, but through time and effort Ben was able to overcome his fears and inspire those around him. Ben has gone from earning £5 an hour at Pizza Hut to pay his way through university to running one of the most exciting and fastest growing companies in the country. It was an absolute pleasure to sit down with him and hear his wisdom, and I know that you’ll think exactly the same way. Topics: Your early years Co-founders Developing yourself personally &amp; within Gymshark The Worst Character traits in business Learning how to speak in front of people &amp; a camera Why are you vlogging inside gymshark? Gymshark through the pandemic What do you wish you knew sooner in business? Struggles with business personally The future of Gymshark Advice for young entrepreneurs The last guests question Ben: https://www.instagram.com/benfrancis/ https://twitter.com/BenFrancis1992?s=20 Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos Sponsor: Huel - https://uk.huel.com/

      <title>Moment 37 - There Is ALWAYS A Way: Holly Tucker</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Holly Tucker MBE has over twenty years experience building businesses. After working in advertising, media, and for a start-up, Holly gave it all up to start Not On The High Street, an online start-up with an inspiring mission: to give a wider platform for small businesses to compete with high street chains. I don’t think anything truly encapsulates the power of optimism in a better way as this moment episode with Holly. It doesn’t matter who you are, what you’ve gone through or where you decide to go, there is always a way to achieve what truly matters most to you. Episode 92 - https://g2ul0.app.link/VBEo4l8wcmb Holly: https://www.instagram.com/hollytucker/ https://holly.co/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>E111: The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck: Mark Manson</title>
      <description>Mark Manson is the phenomenon behind ‘The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck’ and ‘Everything is F*cked’. He has sold over 13 million books and his blog, Life Advice That Doesn’t Suck, receives millions of views every month. His new book is co-written with Will Smith and is called ‘Will’. Mark is an interesting character with a fascinating story. Quitting his first proper job in finance within weeks, Mark ended up as a pick-up artist. He has since become critical of the pick-up artist industry, although said his job was more providing a kind of therapy for men rather than trying to attract girls. Mark’s message, although controversial to some, helps millions of people face their challenges and be the most confident version of themselves. Today, he brings that message to us. So you can judge for yourselves. Your early years Pickup artistry Rejection and self worth in relationships Fundamental characteristics of a good relationship Trying to find purpose Why you have to treat people well How to figure out what you actually want The values that allow you to be fulfilled Personal responsibility Is happiness a choice?

      <title>E110: Molly Mae: How She Became Creative Director Of PLT At 22</title>
      <description>It feels like Molly-Mae has been a cultural figure for a long time, and yet she’s only 22. After coming off Love Island in 2019, Molly has only grown and become more relevant with time. One of the biggest influencers in the world, Molly is so much more than your typical reality tv star. In a rare sit-down interview, Molly opens up to us what she’s trying to achieve with her profile, and where she’s going next. Coming into the spotlight at a very young age, Molly tells us what the experience of overnight fame was really like, what its challenges were, and what she wants to do with it. Molly is someone who is only at the beginning of her journey, and what really came across when she spoke to us was her still unsatiated ambition, and how she’s always looking to achieve more. Molly is definitely someone we’re going to be hearing a lot more from, after speaking to her I think I began to understand why. Topics Your early years How do you balance your time? Love Island &amp; wanting more Your social life What are the downsides to your success? How do you switch off? How do you stay relatable? Are you happy with all of this? The decision to remove the filler from your face Impostor syndrome Money and finance lessons from all of this Pretty Little Thing - Creative Director role The break-in to your home Do you miss your old life? Whats it like being a women in business? Tommy and your relationship Whats next for you?

      <title>E107: Starling Bank: Building a $1.5 Billion Business Against The Odds: Anne Boden</title>
      <description>The story of how Anne built her business is a genuine blockbuster of entrepreneurship and perseverance. Starling is one of the biggest FinTech companies in the world, with billions in deposits, but after listening to this you’ll be amazed how it was possible. When her co-founder walked out of the company, and took the funding with him, Anne walked in to an office where she was the only employee on the books, and had to start the company she’d built all over again. Little by little, she came back, and a year later landed a mega investment deal in one of the most incredible stories we’ve ever had on this podcast. What really shines about Anne is the clear sense of mission she’s infused her company with. Anne really cares about doing right by the customer, and cleaning up an industry that historically doesn’t have a record of giving people a fair shake. Anne is in business to make the world a better place, and we think after listening to this you’ll agree that Anne’s story shows business success can come from the most unlikely places. Topics Humble beginnings Entrepreneurship Starting Starling bank &amp; clashes with Tom at Monzo Raising funding What have you learnt about raising investment?

Anne is in business to make the world a better place, and we think after listening to this you’ll agree that Anne’s story shows business success can come from the most unlikely places. Topics Humble beginnings Entrepreneurship Starting Starling bank &amp; clashes with Tom at Monzo Raising funding What have you learnt about raising investment?

      <title>Moment 32 - Ant Middleton on How To Build A Bulletproof Mindset</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. If you need advice on how to build a solid mindset, then Ant Middleton is certainly the man for the job. He’s been in some of the most dangerous, high-stress and uncomfortable situations on the planet which is why I felt compelled to ask him how he built a mindset strong enough to deal with extreme distress. Ant talks eloquently on how he believes the answer lies within discomfort, something we’re not often pushed towards in the modern world. But with life’s inevitable chaos constantly on the horizon, building a strong mindset isn’t just desirable, it’s necessary. Episode 74 - https://g2ul0.app.link/jOrYmdr9flb Ant: https://www.instagram.com/antmiddleton/ https://twitter.com/antmiddleton Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1 THE DIARY OF A CEO LIVE TICKETS ON SALE NOW 🚀- https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive

Bruce Daisley (Ex VP of Twitter) explains beautifully how we can almost instantaneously engage the creative parts of our brains and allow ideas to flow. Here’s how to instantly improve your creativity.

      <title>E105: Patrice Evra: Learning How To Cry Saved My Life</title>
      <description>Patrice Evra is a one of a kind. He has suffered more hardships, and has overcome more challenges to get where he is, than probably any other guest I’ve ever had on the show. And yet, Patrice has managed to overcome them all to lead an incredible life. If Patrice can overcome his background and experiences, you can overcome yours. In this episode, Patrice opens up as never before on his background and his experiences when he was young, and after listening to this you’ll want to join us in thanking him for his honesty. Patrice has come through experiences most of us can’t even imagine. Patrice also gives us the inside on what made Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United such a winning machine, what people have got wrong about it, and where people go wrong in trying to achieve their own successful mindsets. In this podcast, you’ll be schooled on how to reach the top, and how to stay there. Topics: Your early years Child abuse Your brother Toxic masculinity What does football mean to you Joining Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson You and Luis Suarez Being the best person you can be The last guests question Patrice: https://www.instagram.com/patrice.evra/?hl=en Patrice’s Book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Patrice-Evra/e/B07FZD3YMC%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1 The Diary Of A CEO live - Sign up here - https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive Sponsor: https://uk.huel.com/

        <![CDATA[<p>Of all the guests I’ve had on, these have been the moments that have impacted me most. I don’t often talk about the moments that I’ve found most personally moving, but I thought I’d share them with you today. I’ve selected six moments, from all the guests we’ve had on, that offer the most life-changing advice. If you’re new to this podcast, this is definitely the place to start. I found these moments the most meaningful, the most enlightening, and the most inspiring. From Elizabeth Day talking about the importance of failure, to Jamil Querishi talking about how you can find consistency, to Matthew Syed on building self-confidence and self-esteem.

      <title>E103: 6 BEST Pieces Of Business Advice That Made Me Millions</title>
      <description>This episode, we’re doing something a bit different and I answer the questions that are most pressing to you. Over the past few weeks, more and more people have been reaching out to me for my advice and my opinion on the issues that matter most to them. We’re covering everything from how to best focus your time, imposter syndrome, what character traits it takes to build a successful business, how to reach out to successful people for advice, and what motivates me to get out of bed in the morning. Thinking about things so directly helped put them in a bit more perspective for me, and I hope they can for you as well. In this community, we’re all about helping everyone, no matter who they are, to be the best version of themselves. We’ve had some incredible stories in the last few weeks, and we’ve got more to come. But I thought it would be important to pause, reflect, and take a step back. In the process I’ve found more clarity about some things important to me, and I think after listening to this you will too. Topics: Where do I best focus my time? Important character traits to build a successful business. How to overcome imposter syndrome. How to reach out to senior level people. Three things to look out for to know you’re on the right path to success. What gets you out of bed in the morning.

      <title>E101: The Happiness Expert That Made 51 Million People Happier: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>It’s hard to know where to begin describing such an incredible person as Mo Gawdat. He’s co-founded over 20 businesses, he’s the author of the ground-breaking ‘Solve for Happy’ and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the ‘moonshot factory’ where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots. But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the ‘happiness equation’, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more.

      <title>E99: How I Built 5 Multi-Million Dollar Companies: Marcia Kilgore</title>
      <description>Marcia Kilgore is responsible for revolutionising the beauty industry through the multiple multi-million dollar businesses she’s founded and built. She’s the woman behind Beauty Pie, Fit Flops, Bliss spas, Soap and Glory and Soaper Duper. Marcia moved to New York with just $300, which she spent on a gym membership, became a personal trainer and started a one room studio where she provided facials and spa treatments. Within a few years she’d built a spa empire and sold it to LVMH for millions and millions of dollars. What’s incredible about Marcia is she never stops moving and innovating, and she hasn’t just got lucky once with one successful business, but has managed to do it again and again. Now, Marcia runs a beauty empire. Today she tells us what it took to get to that point, what she’s learnt along the way, and what she had to give up. Topics: Your early years The gym &amp; moving to New York The start of Bliss Attention to detail and maintaining a high standard What is it about you that made you successful Can you teach people to have good ideas Selling Bliss Starting Soap and Glory Coming up with new ideas Why was Soap and Glory so successful and selling it Having an entrepreneurial partner The death bed test Choosing yourself rather than others choosing you What are you playing for now Failures Advice for people of where to start Marcia: https://www.instagram.com/marcia.kilgore/?hl=en https://twitter.com/marciakilgore The Diary Of a CEO live - Sign up here - https://g2ul0.app.link/diaryofaceolive Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com/ https://www.fiverr.com/ceo

      <title>Moment 24 - Mary Portas on Finding Your Truth When You’re Feeling Lost</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It’s becoming more and more apparent that in the modern world, many people are losing touch with who they really are. The systems of society which we live in today are turning us away from our truths and toward becoming who we think we’re supposed to be. Like many others, Mary Portas was once one of those people. The high street queen had it all, and yet she admits something was missing. In this moment clip, Mary reveals how she lost herself, and thankfully, how she found her truth.

      <title>Moment 23 - Why You Should Embrace Failure: Elizabeth Day</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Failure is something which we will all inevitably meet throughout our lives, yet it’s something we all seem to have an incredibly toxic relationship with. Elizabeth Day is the author of ‘Failosophy’ and host of ‘How To Fail with Elizabeth Day’ so it’s no surprise that Elizabeth has a thing or two to say about failure. In this ‘moment’ from the podcast, Elizabeth and I read a couple of her 7 principles on failure from her book. Episode 77 - https://g2ul0.app.link/Iv9fxRGJzjb Elizabeth: https://twitter.com/elizabday https://www.instagram.com/elizabday/

      <title>E97: Moonpig Founder: How I Built A $150 Million Business WITHOUT Sacrifice: Nick Jenkins</title>
      <description>Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. Nick knows what it takes to build a business from nothing to change an industry, and today he’s sharing his wisdom with us on what he’s learnt along the way. You’ll also know Nick from Dragons Den, on which he was a dragon for two years. Since leaving the den he’s become a leading investor in e-commerce and green energy, tutoring and giving a leg up to businesses which help to bring the future a little bit closer every day. Nick is an incredible guy and an astute and proven businessman, but more importantly he’s a grounded and inspirational individual. Nick doesn’t lead a flashy lifestyle or found businesses just to get rich, but instead sees his businesses as attractive solutions to real problems we all face. Before Monopig, Nick used to tipex out greetings on cards and write his own because no one was offering a personalised service. He doesn’t have to do that anymore, he has a billion pound company to do it for him. Being an entrepreneur Starting a business - Moon Pig Stepping back from MoonPig and hiring people Your personal sacrifice Maintaining Focus The importance of being able to communicate well Dragons Den Selling Moonpig You seem very balanced The next chapter of your life What to do if you don't like your job? Being happy with where you are We’re going on tour!

      <title>Moment 22 - How To Turn Your Ambition Into Action: Jamil Qureshi</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It’s fair to say that most people possess ambition, yet almost all of those people fail to turn it into the required action to achieve. So it begs the question, why do we fail to act upon our ambitions? I put this question to the World Leading Psychologist and High Performance Coach Jamil Qureshi. Not only is his answer incredibly compelling, but it could be the key to unlocking your full potential.

      <title>Moment 21 - Professor Green on The Source Of Your Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Professor Green’s accomplishments as a white rapper, at the time he found success, is a staggering achievement. An achievement which, perhaps, wouldn’t be expected from a young guy dealing drugs to get by. So in this clip I ask Professor Green, aka Stephen Paul Manderson, to explain how he found success in his career, and then happiness. Episode 80: https://g2ul0.app.link/7FV8iDIJcjb Professor Green: https://www.instagram.com/professorgreen/ https://twitter.com/professorgreen

      <title>E95: How To Build A Following Of 10 Million +: Mrwhosetheboss</title>
      <description>Arun Maini is the UK’s number one technology influencer, with over 10 million followers across his social media, and over 1.2 billion views on his youtube channel Mrwhosetheboss. Today, he’s talking exclusively to us about his life, his passions and how he made it to the top. Arun started small, using a camera given to him by someone and reviewing technology he could borrow from his friends. Today, he still records in his bedroom, but his job takes him all over the world, and a positive word from him is sought after by Apple, Samsung and technology companies the world over. In his first extended sit-down interview, Arun talks to us about how he gives his all to every task he does, how he stays focused, and how his very competitive nature drove him to the top. But he also opens up about the pressures he faces. And he comes clean about how the very instincts that drive him on can make him his own worst enemy. Topics: Your early years Building confidence &amp; practicing gratitude Playing out your dream to the detriment of myself Hard work What made you go after your calling? How do you maintain meaningful relationships? Money How do you enjoy aspects outside the excitement of YouTube? Your growth on Youtube The biggest misconceptions of you as a Youtuber What are your motivations now? Arun: https://www.youtube.com/user/Mrwhosetheboss https://twitter.com/Mrwhosetheboss?s=20 https://www.instagram.com/mrwhosetheboss/?hl=en Sponsor: https://uk.huel.com/

      <title>Moment 20 - Jim Chapman on How He Overcame His Failure Anxiety</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It seems that in the modern world we live in ‘anxiety’ is a word we are all becoming far too familiar with. The same can be said for many celebrities and online personalities who at first glance may seem untouchable, however when you look a little deeper, no one has it all worked out. In this extremely open and honest clip, Jim reveals how a complicated childhood became the source of many of his issues. He also reveals how he has come to identify and overcome his anxiety for both himself and his new family on the way! Episode 78 - https://g2ul0.app.link/zubmaijq0ib Jim: https://www.youtube.com/user/j1mmyb0bba https://www.instagram.com/jimchapman/ https://twitter.com/jimchapman

      <title>E94: How I Make $1.2 Million A Year From This Podcast</title>
      <description>This week we’re doing something a bit different, and telling you everything you need to know about the business of podcasting. Have you ever wanted to know what goes into an episode of The Diary of a CEO? The truth of the relationship with our sponsors, the equipment we use, and where I want this podcast to go. Well, now’s your chance. This podcast has been an incredible journey, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built. When I started this podcast, it was just me in my bedroom speaking alone into a microphone. Now, we’re the number one business podcast in Europe for over 40 consecutive weeks. Today, we step back to reflect on that journey. And yet, I’ve found that what inspired me to make the podcast then is the same what inspires me to make it now. I’ve always loved sharing incredible stories with you. I’ve always loved pulling out and sharing those little secrets in how people achieve - and maintain - success. And I still hope nobody’s listening, but if you are, then you keep this to yourself. Topics: Consistency Getting your podcast discovered Maintaining a high quality of work Money Why I started and new reasons to keep going Our Youtube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/StevenBartlettYT FOLLOW ► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/steven/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/SteveBartlettSC Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-bartlett-56986834/ Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com/ https://myenergi.com/?utm_source=steven_bartlett&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=podcast http://fiverr.com/ceo

      <description>Ali Abdaal is a first in his class Cambridge graduate who is an expert in productivity and getting the most out of your life. He finished top of his year at Cambridge, but he wasn’t content with mastering productivity in one field: as well as being a full time student, he built a multi-million dollar business, as well as a youtube channel with over two million subscribers. Ali manages to squeeze every moment from his day. Yet when you listen to this, you’ll see that the techniques he uses to do this are really simple. He’s learnt them through hard-fought experience, and today he’s willing to share them with us.

With so much he packs into his life, Ali is quite simply the best out there at helping you to maximise your productive potential. Today, he opens up like never before to reveal exactly how he does it all, and how you can too. Ali: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg https://www.instagram.com/aliabdaal/?hl=en Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com/ http://fiverr.com/ceo

      <title>E92: NotOnTheHighStreet.com Founder: Rapid Success Lead To My Darkest Days: Holly Tucker</title>
      <description>Holly Tucker MBE has over twenty years experience building businesses, and today she shares that insight with us. After working in advertising, media, and for a start-up, Holly gave it all up to start Not On The High Street, an online start-up with an inspiring mission: to give a wider platform for small businesses to compete with high street chains. Known as ‘Hurricane Holly’ for always doing everything quickly, she started Not On the High Street in 2006. Then, it was just one of three online marketplaces in the world, the other two being Amazon and Ebay. Now, her business is going from strength to strength, and employs over 200 people from her West London base.

      <title>Moment 17 - Russell Kane Reveals The Simple Path To Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Russell Kane was one of the most surprising guests I’ve ever had on this podcast. Not only is he intelligent and self-aware, but he is also very straight-talking, which is one of the reasons why I believe this ‘moment’ from the podcast is so powerful. Together, Russell and I were discussing success and what it truly takes to become a successful person. In actual fact, the path to success is a pretty simple one, but sometimes the most simple truths can be the most demanding. Episode 79 - https://g2ul0.app.link/5lybE6twDib Russell: https://twitter.com/russell_kane https://www.instagram.com/russell_kane/

      <title>E89: Dr Alex George: My Hardest Day In A&amp;E, Family Suicide &amp; Finding TRUE Purpose.</title>
      <description>Alex George is a pure inspiration, thats one of the best ways I can describe him, he’s selfless, self aware and just an all round great guy. Having grown up in Nantgaredig, a village near Carmarthen, Wales. He is the oldest of three children. George studied Medicine at the University of Exeter and went on to work in Emergency Medicine at University Hospital Lewisham in London. In 2018, George appeared in the fourth series of the ITV2 reality dating series Love Island. Following the show, he returned to working part-time at Lewisham whilst also making regular media appearances speaking about mental health on ITV morning shows including Good Morning Britain, Lorraine and Loose Women. In 2019 George launched his podcast The Waiting Room with Dr Alex in which he interviews other healthcare professionals about topical health and wellbeing issues. In July 2020, George's youngest brother Llyr died by suicide. In January 2021, George launched a campaign requesting the UK Government prioritise mental health amongst children and adolescents. During Children's Mental Health Week in February 2021, George met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed George to the newly created position of Youth Mental Health Ambassador. In addition, George also became a member of the Mental Health in Education Action Group. This conversation has it all, its gripping, its open, it’s honest and it had me nearly in tears almost 3 or 4 times. I can’t express to you how selfless and down to earth this guy is but you’ll find that out from our conversation today. Alex: https://www.instagram.com/dralexgeorge/?hl=en https://twitter.com/dralexgeorge Sponsor: uk.huel.com

      <title>E88: Deliveroo Founder - From £0 to £5 Billion: Will Shu</title>
      <description>Deliveroo, wow this company is HUGE! I’m sure most of you would have used it but do you know anything about the guy behind it? My guest this week is Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Born in 1979, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, Shu grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. His mother, a scientist, and father, who worked in insurancem. He founded Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend and software engineer Greg Orlowski. Deliveroo operated in London for the first two years, growing via word of mouth. It now operates in 12 countries and more than 200 cities. Deliveroo is worth £5 billion, becoming Europes fastest growing company with 2,000+ employees. In mid-June 2016, Will and Greg received an award for the Best Startup Founders as part of The Europas Startup Conference and Awards, mainly given to technology companies. The company also received Fastest Rising Startup of the Year and the Europas Grand Prix award. In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by £460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add £372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to £1.5 billion in the year to June 2019. By mid 2020, Deliveroo had not benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged. Deliveroo reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Will talks about how hard this decision was that the time in today podcast. Will is an incredible entrepreneur, one thats a far cry from the usual braggadocios CEO of a multi billion dollar company. He’s a humble person and lives a very modest lifestyle saying his life hasn’t change much at all since the early days of Deliveroo. This is conversation proved to me that you don’t have to be born an entrepreneur. This weeks topics: Your early years What made you take on this industry? Your riders being discriminated against The name of the company at the start Your co-founder What were some of your hardest challenges? Your mental health journey One of my hardest moments in Delieveroo What do you do to relax? Challenges of having a romantic relationship as a CEO Delieveroo's IPO journey I still do deliveries Your thinking around competition Money What are you aiming for? Will: https://twitter.com/willshuroo?lang=fr Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com/ https://myenergi.com/?utm_source=steven_bartlett&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=podcast

      <title>Moment 13 - I Have a Secret To Tell You</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Over the last few years I have gradually come to understand why, broadly, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. This ‘secret’ which only the rich possess is something which I learned only when I became rich myself. In this ‘Moment’ episode of my podcast, I’m going to reveal this ‘secret’ to you all, as I explain why the pursuit of knowledge is the greatest decision you will ever make and how cleansing your social media ‘diet’ can vastly improve your chances of success.

      <title>E87: The Rise, The Fall &amp; The Rebuild Of True Geordie</title>
      <description>My guest this week is my friend and all round good guy True Geordie, otherwise known as Brian Davis. Brian is from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He was born on a council estate, raised mostly by his mother as he describes his father being in and out of prison and not really being the father figure he desperately needed. When Brian left home he went to work on the oil rigs, scuba diving to work on them underwater. He describes how this would put him into life or death situations on a daily basis. The colleges he gained on the oil rigs became his father figures. After leaving the oil rigs he started YouTube under the name footballfan533, and first rose to prominence when his first video (titled A True Geordie's view on Nile Ranger) went viral. Brian quickly gained a following due to his expletive and passionate opinions, and therefore changed his channel name to True Geordie, uploading more regularly. He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous True Geordie Podcast, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna. Geordie was chosen the host and commentator for the KSI V Joe Weller fight in February 2018. He had previously been a commentator for some of the charity football matches. I met Brian back in 2017 to record his podcast, we recorded it in a tiny abandoned bomb shelter that he paid £50 a day to rent out. Brian has come a long way since then, running a rapidly growing Youtube channel thats accumulating millions upon millions of views per week, he’s commentated on one of the largest Youtube events in history and he’s also created some of the best content I’ve ever seen. All of this was quickly ripped away from him last year after one of the hardest weeks of his life, something we talk a lot about today. He’s gone through it all, been to the darkest of places, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. However this didn’t stop him getting back on his feet and rebuilding himself from the ground up, coming back bigger and better than before. Topics: Your early years The rise of True Geordie The fall of True Geordie You Mother Your Dad Your experiences with anxiety Your depression You never relax Attaching your happiness to a future goal What the cost of being ambitious? Whats the big ambition? Do you get the credit you deserve? Do you think you’re happy? Reaching my goals or at least trying to How has fitness been for your mental health? You stopped podcasting &amp; turned off comments?

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Krissy Cela wasn’t always the sassy, confident woman we all know her as today. In fact, like many other successful people, there was a period of time in which Krissy struggled. This is the story of how the ‘foreign girl with a moustache at school’ discovered her self-confidence and in turn, discovered her true self. Episode 57 - https://g2ul0.app.link/tEZovAdYvhb

      <title>E86: Monzo CEO On Death Threats, Depression &amp; Digital Banking Wars - Tom Blomfield</title>
      <description>Tom Blomfield, wow what an entrepreneur. This guy has founded multiple multi-million-pound companies, that have become monumental disrupters in the industry. And let’s face it, Monzo, one of the companies Tom founded and led, is the one of the most forward-thinking, innovative, fastest-growing companies there is. Tom was born in Hong Kong and lived with his father and mother. His father was a business-minded civil engineer and his mother was an artist. When Tom was a child, he moved to London to attend grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire then moving on to study Law at Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, at the age of 21, he co-founded Boso.com an “eBay for students”. After a few internships with law firms he decided being a lawyer wasn't for him and followed the entrepreneurial journey instead. In January 2011 Blomfield co-founded the UK-based company GoCardless, an automated payment method that processes Direct Debit payments on behalf of other businesses and organisations. Blomfield stayed in Silicon Valley during his three years at the company, it raised around £35 million of investment and hired 100 people. When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a "very small share" in the £50-100m valued company) Tom moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016. Following his departure from Grouper Social Club Blomfield joined Anne Boden’s Starling bank as the CTO. Startling was, at that point one of the first digital banking companies. Tom left the company in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that "he could not comment under the terms of his departure". Today we learn about what really happened at Starling. In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo, operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online In its first fundraising round, the company raised "£1 million in 96 seconds”. In April, Blomfield announced he would forgo his salary for one year to help his company during the COVID-19 pandemic In May, he announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Monzo and taking on the role of president of the company. In January 2021 he announced he was leaving the company permanently. This conversation today takes us through Tom’s wild entrepreneurial journey expressing the highs and lows of running a business. He also talks about the disagreements at Starling bank and ultimately his reason for starting Monzo in the first place. His stories are unique, and more importantly honest. Unbelievably honest. He tells you the mistakes he made, his deepest insecurities, his biggest challenges and the things he wish he knew. Wow this is a good one. Why entrepreneurship? What made you want to disrupt an industry? Monzo &amp; Starling rivalry Starting Monzo Wanting to be seen to be a success What were the good times at Monzo? What were the bad times at Mozo? Was the business model of Monzo bad? Leaving Monzo Not sleeping because of the stress of the business How was holding down a relationship while running the business? The “red phone” in your bedroom What was your life like outside of the business? The road to leaving Monzo The urge to go back Death Threats Enjoying the small things in life and relationships Your purpose in life Crypto currencies The good things about being a CEO Tom: https://twitter.com/t_blom https://www.li

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. At the time of recording this episode, I had been in a constant loop of feeling motivated to go to the gym and get in shape for the summer, then slowly seeing that motivation die off by the time the summer had passed. In this ‘Moment’ I break down the reasons why I became stuck in my ‘summer bod’ loop and how we can shift our mindset in order to build consistent motivation.

      <title>E85: Mary Portas - How To Stop Living A Life That Isn't True To You</title>
      <description>My guest this week is Mary Portas. You may know Mary from the high street, from business, or you may know her as the red bob, hard exterior business woman from the TV. In this conversation today I saw a very different one to the one I’ve seen in the media. Mary Portas is an English retail consultant and broadcaster, known for her retail and business-related television shows, founding her creative agency Portas and her appointment by David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, to lead a review into the future of Britain's high streets. She’s worked in various retail roles: John Lewis and Harrods, Topshop. Then creative director at Harvey Nichols – which was her rise to fame. In 1997 launched an agency called Yellow Door producing campaigns for clients including Clarks, Louis Vuitton, Oasis Stores, Swarovski, Dunhill, Boden, Thomas Pink, Patek Philippe and Mercedes-Benz, Sainsbury's, Habitat, Westfield, Liberty and The Body Shop. In 2013 she re-launched her agency as Portas Agency Ltd. Today, Portas Agency advises retail clients from every continent, and the businesses success is built on an obsessive understanding of human and cultural behaviour. Today she’ll talk about an idea thats fairly radical to some people, especially people that are building or have built big businesses which is based on her new book ‘Rebuild: How to thrive in the new Kindness Economy’. This conversation incredible, Mary is hilarious, she is smart and she is kind. On top of all that her brutal honesty blew me away which is a central part of what we spoke about, the idea of being true to yourself or facing the inevitable of ending up in disappear. Mary’s been a public figure, a media star, she’s faced public scrutiny but through it all she’s emerged as this levelled headed, down to earth, warm hearted individual. I laughed, I realised and I was deeply inspired and you will be too. This weeks topics: Your early years Your most painful moments Remote working Losing myself in the madness Labelling your sexuality Listing to your intuition Advice for the younger generation So you don’t get excited either? Making businesses kinder What does it mean for businesses to be kinder? Meditation Have you struggled with relationships because of business? Mary’s book - Rebuild: How to thrive in the new Kindness Economy - https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08V85WGNK Mary: https://twitter.com/maryportas https://www.instagram.com/maryportasofficial/ Sponsors: uk.huel.com www.fiverr.com/ceo

      <title>Moment 10 - Jake Humphrey On The Building Blocks Of Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this clip, Jake Humphrey explains that understanding the ‘building blocks’ to success is what truly made him successful. He claims the ‘trick’ is to take absolute responsibility for everything in your life. Jake then tells us that now that he has his success, it feels somewhat underwhelming and anticlimactic as he reveals that he doesn’t yet ‘feel’ successful.

      <title>Moment 9 - Eddie Hearn on The Sacrifices Behind Being Relentless</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this clip, Eddie Hearn reveals how his childhood in the shadow of his highly-successful father, Barry Hearn, turned him into the ‘relentless’ sports promoter and businessman he is today. We also talk about some of the sacrifices Eddie has had to make in order to make it to the top and discuss how even something as important as family can often become neglected in his pursuit of success.

      <title>E83: Liam Payne Opens Up About His Darkest Moments, Failed Relationships &amp; Entrepreneurship</title>
      <description>Liam Payne has been subjected to the intensity of the spotlight from the age of just 14, when he found global fame following his entry in to the X Factor’s seventh series, and the dizzying rise once he exited as one fifth of the group One Direction. The band was cemented as a phenomenon overnight-their success and the surrounding hype was likened to that of a modern-day Beatles at time of their debut single release. They became the first UK group ever to have their debut album reach number one in the United States. There probably are not many who are better placed than Liam to discuss instantaneous fame and the churning of its 'machine’. Liam has gone from a teen star to a fully-fledged solo artist who has taken ownership of his career in terms of its creative direction and elevated further with a strong signature pop/rnb style and a string of hits both here and abroad. He’s had his music streamed over a total of 2bn times. However, there is much more to him than the image of simply being a teen heartthrob or sugary popstar. The X Factor may be notorious for churning out ‘instant’ popstars but Liam clearly has a deep appreciation for music and the process behind its production. He studied as a musician prior to the start of his mainstream career and has grown as a gifted songwriter, with 40+ writing and co-writing credits to his name. He has previously said that he is accustomed to writing and recording entire albums in six weeks or less, and his evolution on personal and creative levels has no doubt been accelerated by his exposure. This conversation today isn’t your normal “reunion chat” we speak about so much in a lot of depth, everything from his relationships, his darkest times and everything in-between. Its open, its honest and its inspiring. During our conversation Liam mentioned it was one of the best chats he’d had in a while and I felt that, I hope you do too. This weeks topics: Lockdown &amp; the gym Dealing with being famous Your relationship status Being a perfectionist Alcoholism One Direction &amp; the costs Your NFT project Where would you be if you hadn't gone on X-Factor Your relationship with the rest of boys &amp; touring I am lucky to be here, have I hit my rock bottom You made a movie? What does the next 10 years looks like for you? Your relationship with money Your son applies to X-Factor what do you say? What don’t we know about you? Social media What makes you happy? What's your next ‘mountain’?

      <title>E82: Johann Hari - Everything You Think You Know About Meaning &amp; Happiness Is Wrong</title>
      <description>This podcast is a real treat and a podcast that you cannot miss! Johann has come back and what honour it was to record. He has to be my all-time favourite guest ever! His book ‘Lost Connections’ had such a positive, transformative impact on my life and truly changed my perspective on how I viewed depression &amp; addiction. I am sure that the information shared today will be valuable and important topics that our society needs to hear. Johann is a very successful and inspirational British-Swiss writer and journalist with 2 books hitting The New York Times best sellers list. Born in Glasgow Scotland then relocated to London when he was young, Johann experienced some childhood trauma having suffered from being physically abused as child and his mother suffering from an illness. Starting his career as a journalist he won many awards such as Journalist of the year and was named by the Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people. Johann then went to onto being an author writing the worldwide known “Lost Connections” and “Chasing the Scream”. He also released a TED talk back in 2015 “Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong” which has now over 17 million views. This honest conversation lasted around 2 hours and we even went on into the evening off air. I genuinely think that this might be the most important podcast you choose to ignore. I’m not giving much away, but you will thank me after. Topics: Why do you like writing books? Rat Park Working from home, living through screens Finding meaning within the machine Are we struggling to form meaningful connections How good are you at making connections Psychedelics Is Social media helping us rally together Your new book &amp; your writing style Social media Johann: https://www.instagram.com/johann.hari/ https://twitter.com/johannhari101 VOTE FOR US FOR BEST BRITISH PODCAST: https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/vote?utm_source=emailoctopus&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Nominated Sponsor: uk.huel.com/

      <title>E81: Ben Fogle - Overcoming My Lifelong Battle With Self-doubt</title>
      <description>Ben Fogle, a TV presenter broadcaster and author who has reached the peak of Everest, trekked over Antarctica and rowed across the vast Atlantic ocean. A man that has faced adventure and put himself in the most high risk situations doesn’t usually pair with low confidence issues and fighting his own insecurity. Born in Westminster everyone perceives him with a life of privilege, comfort and a quintessential posh lifestyle. Failing at school and only just got through his university studies. Ben had determination for travel and exploring, he lived on a island self-sufficiently for year, presented and made numerous of well-known documentaries, written 9 Times Best selling books and is the United Nations Patron of the Wilderness. There is more to this man than I believed the conversation we had was so diverse we covered so much, going through Ben’s journey getting down the core of the man everyone see’s smiling in behind the lens. A chance for him to express in his words who he really is and the voyage of taking back control of his own narrative. This podcast is going to open your eyes to reality and surprise you in ways you did not expect. The demand we have for materialistic things, to be happy all the time and push ourselves and take those leaps make us question what is happy and how can we be more fulfilled. Topics: Where does your thirst for challenge come from? Overthinking &amp; building confidence conforming I don't know if I'll ever find who I really am Money value Social media and Trolling Wokness Failure, self doubt and self belief Your wife, preventative marriage concealing Anxiety and looking for happiness What is your goal? Are you scared of dying? Have you got any regrets? Advice for unconfident people Ben: https://www.instagram.com/benfogle/ https://twitter.com/benfogle Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com/ Fiverr.com/ceo

      <title>E80: Professor Green - How To Overcome Life’s Hardest Challenges &amp; Find A Purpose.</title>
      <description>We all know Professor Green aka Stephen Manderson for his multiple chart topping songs throughout the years but there is so much behind each and every track inspired by his rocky upbringing, to say he has faced and overcome adversity to reach where he is would be a real understatement. He was born and raised in Hackney, growing up on one of the most notoriously troubled council estates at the time. He has won a number of personal battles ranging from health trauma and poverty to parental abandonment. Stephen's mother gave birth to him at 16 years old and left him and the home when he was just one year old. His father was absent for the vast majority of the time, leaving Stephen troubled and alienated. He was raised by his nan Pat. Stephen was stabbed in the neck in a near fatal attack with a broken glass bottle in a Shoreditch nightclub when he was 26. Convinced that he would die, he fled the club in shock and phoned both his mother and grandmother to say 'goodbye'. In 2008, Stephen tragically lost his father to suicide by hanging. He opened up on this is in his pivotal documentary 'Suicide and Me' released in 2015 for BBC III. They had had a difficult relationship prior and only occasional contact -he had not seen him face to face for six years before to having to identify his body, and his last words to his father had followed a bitter argument. In 2017, Stephen had a major health crisis and ended up with “a paralysed stomach”, totally unable to digest food. He managed to heal himself in large part through his own research and combinations of gut/balancing products. Since identifying a gap in the market for similar solutions through his own health battle, he has converted that newfound knowledge and research into co-founding liquid supplement company Aguulp, its product range receiving rave reviews so far. Stephen is incredibly level-headed and self aware despite treading such a rocky path. His constant battle with mental health both personally and within the family has created a mindset that is very unique and this conversation is one that I think everyone needs to hear. Topics: Most pivotal moments from your early years Becoming self-aware - getting older Your dads suicide - mental health The last conversation you had with your dad Finding success and leaving people behind Getting stabbed in the neck How did manage to make it over others? Your new phase of life How have you found the business world?

      <title>Moment 4 - How I Discovered A More Grateful Perspective</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode I look back on a trip I took to India where I got to take a look at what life is like in the slums of Mumbai. This entire experience shifted my perspective completely and yet the most surprising thing about what I was seeing wasn’t the grim reality of poverty, but the unshakable fact that these people were happy. I walked away from those slums with an entirely new perspective on the privilege we have been given from birth, and this is where I introduce how I discovered a more grateful perspective Full episode - https://g2ul0.app.link/uPvHRJw80fb

      <title>Moment 1 - Johann Hari On Why We're Becoming Less Happy And More Lonely</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes I will be selecting my favourite sections from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode Journalist and Author Johann Hari, most well known for writing the New York Times bestselling book ‘Lost Connections’, explains why as humans we are becoming less happy and more lonely. As a species, we are becoming more and more disconnected, and Johann mainly puts this down to the fact that we are being driven by ‘junk’ values. Like junk food, our ‘junk’ values seem to be attractive to us, but really only go on to harm both us and our happiness. Johann explains that only once we begin to understand our intrinsic and extrinsic motivations will we finally be free to live a more connected and happier life.

      <description>This week’s podcast guest, is not like any I’ve had on before... I am proud to introduce to you my friend, and football legend Rio Ferdinand. As a former Football player, he is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time and regarded by many loyal fans – one of England’s greatest players. I grew up as a United Fan, watching him, idolising him and now he is my mate. Growing up on an Estate in Peckham, Rio’s parents encouraged his curiosity. Many of you, may not know, Rio danced ballet to a high standard before choosing to pursue a career in football... and well, you might think you know how the story goes. You don’t. In this open, intimate and honest conversation Rio talks about his achievements, failures, successes and how his life experiences have made him the father he is today. Rio has broken many football records during his premiership – He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for record breaking fee of £30 million. He has featured in the PFA Team of the Year four times in 5 years. More club magic spread, as the club followed with another Premier league Win in 2006-07 all under Sir Alex Fergusons lead. During Rio’s time at United, Rio respectfully won 6 Premier League Titles and 14 Trophies. Rio announced his retirements from professional football on 30 May 2015. After retirement Rio has joined BT Sport as a Pundit. The BBC one documentary - Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The documentary won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards. Rio is a special guy, not least for what he’s achieved but for who he is, and today. You’re going to find out who he actually is. The philosophy to life that he swears by, and the culture required for you to win in an ambitious career, but also the culture required to win in your personal life. This weeks topics: What made you chose football? Culture of avoid discomfort How did they create high standards at Old Trafford? Sir Alex Ferguson Manchester United now Manchester United then What were your faults? You and Vidic Mental health - your documentary Techniques to help with mental health Relationship advice What do you want to be remembered for What matters?

        <![CDATA[<p>This week’s podcast guest, is not like any I’ve had on before... I am proud to introduce to you my friend, and football legend Rio Ferdinand. As a former Football player, he is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time and regarded by many loyal fans – one of England’s greatest players. I grew up as a United Fan, watching him, idolising him and now he is my mate. Growing up on an Estate in Peckham, Rio’s parents encouraged his curiosity. Many of you, may not know, Rio danced ballet to a high standard before choosing to pursue a career in football... and well, you might think you know how the story goes. You don’t. In this open, intimate and honest conversation Rio talks about his achievements, failures, successes and how his life experiences have made him the father he is today. Rio has broken many football records during his premiership – He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for record breaking fee of £30 million. He has featured in the PFA Team of the Year four times in 5 years. More club magic spread, as the club followed with another Premier league Win in 2006-07 all under Sir Alex Fergusons lead. During Rio’s time at United, Rio respectfully won 6 Premier League Titles and 14 Trophies. Rio announced his retirements from professional football on 30 May 2015. After retirement Rio has joined BT Sport as a Pundit. The BBC one documentary - Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The documentary won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards. Rio is a special guy, not least for what he’s achieved but for who he is, and today. You’re going to find out who he actually is. The philosophy to life that he swears by, and the culture required for you to win in an ambitious career, but also the culture required to win in your personal life.

      <title>E74: Ant Middleton Opens Up About His Personal Demons, Being "Cancelled" &amp; His Spirituality</title>
      <description>Ant Middleton is an adventurer, military vet, television host and author who is has become a majorly respected authority when it comes to survival and endurance techniques due to his experience within the elite and special forces. He went on to become of only a handful of those able to complete the military’s gruelling “Holy Trinity”, serving with the Paras, the Royal Marines and Special Forces (in the Special Boat Service, sister force of the SAS). He has served on military tours of Northern Ireland, Macedonia (peacekeeping), Sierra Leone and Afghanistan (in 2007 and 2008). Ant has remained grounded in a philosophy of embracing personal power and individual responsibility at all times. Ant has a very straightforward view of manhood and describes his peers as 'military alpha males'. Ant readily admits that he has been 'exposed' to so much that it's almost impossible for him to feel an adrenaline rush at this stage in his life... Most recently Ant has been caught up in a media storm after Channel 4 axed him from SAS: Who Dares Wins after five years, the broadcaster said that ant’s 'views and values we not aligned to theirs'. This is his first in-depth conversation he recorded since he was “cancelled”. Ant, Thank you for your honesty. This weeks episode entitled 'Ant Middleton Opens Up About His Personal Demons, Being "Cancelled" &amp; His Spirituality' topics: Exorcising my demons What shaped you to who you are today? Why is being honest with yourself so hard these days? Cancel culture Cutting myself off emotionally Whats the worst thing that you brought back from war? How important is personal responsibility? Flipping a negative into a positive  How to have a mindset like you? Spirituality Ant: https://www.instagram.com/antmiddleton/ https://twitter.com/antmiddleton https://www.antmiddleton.com/ My book: UK, US, AUS, NZ Link) - http://hyperurl.co/xenkw2 (EU &amp; Rest of the World Link) - https://www.bookdepository.com/Happy-Sexy-Millionaire-Steven-Bartlett/9781529301496?ref=grid- view&amp;qid=1610300058833&amp;sr=1-2Sponsor Sponsors: https://uk.huel.com https://fiverr.com/ceo

      <title>E69: Grace Beverley: How To Build A Multi-Million Pound Empire At 24</title>
      <description>Grace is an entrepreneur, brand founder, influencer and Oxford University graduate who defied expectations and took her post-grad journey in an unexpected direction by launching 2 major brands: [We Are] TALA (sustainable, slow fashion activewear label) and fitness app Shreddy. TALA’s performance since its launch in 2019 shows it to be one of the biggest positive disruptors in the gymwear space both in the UK and overseas. At the core of the brand is a focus on ethical, eco-efficient manufacture practices. The designs are inclusive in terms of size and shape range: Grace has spoken of the importance of personalising your fitness and health journey rather than subscribing to what's most popular or promoted on social media etc. Grace has remained outspoken on the challenges faced by women in business, even in 2021. A social conscience runs through all three of her companies: up-cycled offcuts and recyclable materials are incorporated into products from TALA while remaining available to consumers at affordable prices. Grace also used to vlog her daily life with great success, sharing her ups and downs as a 20-something year-old. Longtime subscribers of hers have had the chance to join her on a more personal journey. She however stepped away from vlogging a year ago to pursue her business ventures. Grace launched both Shreddy and TALA within a month of her final university exams. She is frequently discussed by followers for her drive and ability to be able to take on multiple projects at once with tons of enthusiasm. Shreddy has received widespread press coverage since its launch, and Grace has recently pulled off a major partnership with celeb/influencer Jordyn Woods in LA, as well as collaborations with brands such as KOI footwear (an exclusive line of vegan footwear released in 2019). - How did you have the confidence to pursue such an uncertain career - How does it feel being discredited for what you've done? - Sacrifice of business - Your mental health - Relationships as a young successful woman - How has being a successful person changed you? - Your take on working culture - By stepping back from social media did you let the negativity win? - What area of business are you best at? - What area of business are you bad at? - Instagram - Any big regrets? - Worries about your book - How do you battle with all your ideas Grace: https://www.instagram.com/gracebeverley/?hl=en Sponsors: uk.huel.com/ www.fiverr.com/ceo My book pre-order: (UK, US, AUS, NZ Link) - http://hyperurl.co/xenkw2 (EU &amp; Rest of the World Link) https://www.bookdepository.com/Happy-Sexy-Millionaire-Steven-Bartlett/9781529301496?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1610300058833&amp;sr=1-2

      <title>E68: Suicidal Drug Addict To Elite Military Commando with Ben Williams</title>
      <description>From an early age Ben was subjected to a violent parent relationship which saw his family break apart, with only his mother to defend both himself and his brother. Through severe bullying and family upheaval, he moved home six times and went to six different schools within ten years of his life. After an unfortunate incident as a nightclub bouncer involving the death of a patron, Ben fell into a world of drug abuse, gambling and addiction, balancing on the brink of life. Broke, with no home or anyone to turn to, he abused his addictions every day and battled suicidal thoughts. Ben saw an advert on YouTube for the Royal Marines and knew he had one chance left at life by joining. Joining the marines gave him a purpose, he trained religiously, day and night to get fit and read and revised military tactics to increase his knowledge. And he didn’t have a single hand in getting clean from the drugs – his mind, determination and sheer drive got him clean – he was thinking differently. During his ten years with the Royal Marines – one of the most elite regiments in the world, Ben travelled the world, seeing active operational duties in Afghanistan. The Corps was a rollercoaster journey involving the extreme highs, and lows of war. After being injured in an IED blast in Afghanistan, he returned to the UK with the horrors of war still imprinted on his mind. He had to stay at home with his thoughts – now in a completely new battle. He turned back into his old self before the marines, drinking, gambling and getting in trouble. The dark thoughts were intrusive. After one alcohol fuelled event, Ben was court-martialed and sent for trial; with his first son on the way he was staring at a four-year sentence for assault, but he fortunately escaped prison by a judge who took pity on him. Broken and at his wits end, a friend lent him ‘the chimp paradox’; and he found himself immersed in self help books and receiving treatment for PTSD. Like a breath of fresh air, his life changed almost instantly. Ben finally found the answers from experts to understand his behaviour. When his demons were brought under control, he was given the opportunity to join the Commando training centre in Lympstone. As a recruit instructor, he entered the world of coaching and helping others; which saw him flourish. As a result of his ability, he ended up working with the England football team, where the next part of the journey begins. After being medically discharged, he now owns a leadership and performance coaching company, Vanguard and Find Your Edge, that helps organisations achieve their goals by employing a new mindset; working with many elite professional sports stars, and elite businesses to achieve more. Topics: - Your Childhood - The desire to be an alpha male - An incident that changed my life forever - My turning point - joining the Royal Marines - How to find that purpose - What the commando mindset? - Why “its taking part that counts” doesn’t work - The thing that ended my time in the Military - Falling back into my old ways - Working with the England football team - Your ARA strategy - The joy of running - Your business Ben: Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/ben_williams_cm/?hl=en His book - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Commando-Mindset-Motivation-Realize-Potential/dp/0241416051 My book pre-order: (UK, US, AUS, NZ Link) - http://hyperurl.co/xenkw2 (EU &amp; Rest of th

      <title>E66: The Secret To Loving Your Work with Bruce Daisley</title>
      <description>Bruce Daisley is one of the world’s most influential voices on fixing workplace culture and a former VP at Twitter. Bruce Daisley spent over a decade as a top executive at Twitter, YouTube and Google for Europe, leaving Twitter as its most senior leader outside of the US. Bruce’s highly acclaimed book, The Joy of Work: 30 Ways to Fix Your Work Culture and Fall in Love with Your Job Again, offers a fascinating and data-tested insight into what ‘work’ and ‘office culture’ now looks-like in the 21st century, as well as advising how all levels of staff within organisations can build a more motivating and productive workplace culture. The book went on to become the UK’s bestselling business hardback of 2019, being translated into 13 languages and long-listed for Business Book of the Year 2020 and CMI Management Book of the Year 2020. His literary and business successes have culminated in Bruce being named one of the Evening Standard’s 1000 Most Influential Londoners and one of Debrett’s 500 Most Influential People in Britain. At the CBI Annual Conference, he was voted the top-rated speaker, having shared the stage with the Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn. Alongside his literary pursuits, Bruce hosts and runs the ‘Eat Sleep Work Repeat’ podcast on workplace culture which has reached #1 spot on the Apple Business Podcast Chart. He now devotes his time to championing reforms to culture in the workplace. He is also a published writer in the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal &amp; The Guardian. This weeks topics: - Your take on this new remote working culture? - What causes burn out? - What kills and causes creativity - How do I know when to quit? - Childhood trauma in the elite - The Trump Twitter ban - Where does social media go from here? - Whats next for you to keep joy in your work? - Whats the one thing you'd do to make work enjoyable for everyone?

      <title>E65: I Won 11 World Titles Because They Said I Couldn't - Anna Hemmings MBE</title>
      <description>My guest this week is kayaking legend Anna Hemmings MBE. Anna is Britain’s most successful female marathon kayaker with a staggering eleven World and European Championship medals, 9 of them gold. By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport. Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong. At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance. Anna’s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year. This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I’ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up. We also delved into her expertise in resilience and high performance, discussing the steps she takes to help people become the greatest version of themselves. This weeks topics: - Why Kayaking? - Why you? - Healthy conflict within teams - Key lessons from your psychologist - How do people overcome their limiting beliefs? - What do you think about this idea of labels? - Your process of visualisation - Your discipline and how to apply it - How do you find what drives other people - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - Benefits of being vulnerable - Overcoming your disorder - The importance of connection - What’s next for you? Anna: annahemmings.com linkedin.com/in/anna-hemmings-mbe/ My book pre-order: (UK, US, AUS, NZ Link) - http://hyperurl.co/xenkw2 (EU &amp; Rest of the World Link) https://www.bookdepository.com/Happy-...

      <description>It’s coming to that time of year when everyone starts to reminisce about the year that has just been and thinks about the changes they can make to have a better, happier future... The thing is though, this year has been different to any other that has gone before! It’s been difficult, it’s been a struggle, it’s been heartbreaking! Within the hard times of life we tend to learn more about ourselves and who we are. For that reason, I’ve decided to host a two part end of year special podcast episode to take a look back at the biggest lessons I’ve learnt during one of the hardest year of our lives and how we can try and make 2021 a better year. Topics: - 2020 - Learn to live while we can - Productivity hack of 2020 - Create a sense of urgency Sponsor - https://uk.huel.com/

This week I sat down with Krissy Cela, this was such a brave, truthful conversation! From being an immigrant, bullied on the school playground to becoming a multi-millionaire entrepreneur, author and one of the UK’s most recognised fitness trainers. Krissy shared the highs, but also the lows of being an entrepreneur that most won’t speak about. She's now the CEO of a business valued at almost £100m. This is the raw, unfiltered truth of Krissy Cela Topics: - Justifying myself as a woman - Building my confidence with the gym - Growing Apart from my ex - I hate talk about my success - Are you hard to date - Your parents - The pressure on women - The bullshit of being an entrepreneur - Somethings o have to give in my life - Are you scared of death - Having friends as an entrepreneur - What are you working on?

      <title>E51: The Certainty Of Unexpected Chaos</title>
      <description>This week's episode of The Diary of a CEO is all about the certainty of unexpected chaos. This is a different episode, for the very different times that we’re living in. But, I think you ALL need to hear this, because I did. I discuss why you should be responsible for your actions, how to be positive amongst all the chaos, stay psychologically effective and the importance of being compassionate with your thoughts. I also delve into what I call "happiness dividends" and discuss why it is vital not give up on your long term goals for short term pleasures, especially in this time of uncertainty.

      <title>E50: Jake Humphrey - My Grandma's Suicide Saved Me</title>
      <description>In my most recent episode of The Diary of a CEO, I sat down with the incredibly successful TV presenter, journalist and entrepreneur Jake Humphrey. Jake has gone from being an unqualified drop out, who was fired from McDonalds after just two months for a lack of communication skills to one of the UK’s most well known TV presenters, with accolades such as CBBC, BT Sport, Formula One and much more. Jake also co-founded the production company Whisper Films, alongside former BBC Sport producer Sunil Patel and David Coulthard and the business has grown from £1.5m to almost £20m. Our conversation was extremely honest and open. Jake has struggled to come to terms with the common misconceptions of who he is, battling suicidal thoughts and developing an unhealthy relationship with social media. We discuss the best way to move forward with the devastating impact social media can have and why failure is the key to being successful.
